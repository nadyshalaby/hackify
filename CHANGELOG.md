# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-11

> **Patch label, minor-level scope.** Despite being a patch release, this is a substantial rewrite of every sub-agent prompt and every clarify-wizard bank in the plugin. The label reflects the maintainer's release-cadence preference, not the underlying change size. Users upgrading from 0.1.2 should expect templates to look different — the workflow phases and DoD shapes are unchanged.

### Closed — the six canonical bugs from the v0.1.0 post-mortem

1. **Soft severity language let unverifiable schema findings get downgraded.** Reviewer A flagged `"source": "."` as "Important — may break under future schema tightening." That qualifier let it be deferred. Result: v0.1.0 install rejected; v0.1.1 + v0.1.2 reshipping cost.
2. **No cross-file consistency requirement in author prompts.** The README author agent had no rule binding its hero tagline to the `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` descriptions. Phase 5 caught the four-way drift after the fact.
3. **No inline verification scripts in many templates.** Agents reported "done" without running the checks that would have caught their own gaps (evals.json contamination almost shipped).
4. **No anchored severity rubrics.** "Mark Critical / Important / Minor" without anchored examples produced inconsistent reviewer outputs.
5. **No placeholder syntax for dispatch-time values.** Each dispatching call handwrote paths and constraints; drift between calls was inevitable.
6. **Research-phase prompts didn't verify the architectural behaviors the plan depended on.** The "commands inside a plugin are namespaced" property wasn't asked about explicitly — only Phase 2.5 caught it.

### Added

- **`references/parallel-agents.md` "Template Contract" preamble** — canonical 7-section structure (ROLE / INPUTS / OBJECTIVE / METHOD / VERIFICATION / SEVERITY [review-only] / OUTPUT). Every sub-agent template in the file conforms. ROLE has 5 mandatory elements: identity + seniority, domain expertise, named standards (cited from a version-pinned allowlist — OWASP Top 10 2021, NIST SP 800-63B, RFC 6749, RFC 7519, WCAG 2.2 AA, SOLID, Clean Code, Conventional Commits 1.0.0, Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, Keep a Changelog 1.1.0, ISO 8601, Postel's law, expand-then-contract migrations), rejected anti-patterns (≥3), behavioral bias (`Bias to:` / `Bias against:`). VERIFICATION comes in two shapes: Executable bash for filesystem-touching templates, Self-checklist yes/no list for prose-producing ones.
- **`references/clarify-questions.md` "Wizard Contract" preamble** — canonical 4-section structure for every task-type bank (SCENARIO / COMPOSITION / QUESTIONS / EXIT CRITERIA). Recommended-first rule documented (option A suffixed " (Recommended)"). Decision-rule COMPOSITION replaces free-choice "use judgment" guidance.
- **`{{snake_case}}` placeholders** for every dispatch-time runtime value. Placeholders are documentation to the dispatching agent (not the sub-agent); a sub-agent receiving literal `{{...}}` text is a dispatch bug.
- **Verbatim canonical SEVERITY line** in every review template: "If you cannot verify a claim against live docs or live code, mark the finding Critical, not Important."
- **`scripts/validate-dod.sh`** extended with six new checks: [9] template structural conformance, [10] SEVERITY conditional (review templates have it, build/research don't), [11] canonical SEVERITY phrase, [12] ROLE 5-element substance check, [13] no leaked absolute paths in template bodies, [14] wizard structural conformance. Existing checks [1]–[8] unchanged.

### Changed

- All 11 sub-agent templates in `references/parallel-agents.md` rewritten to the 7-section contract: Phase 1 Research, Phase 2.5 Spec-review A/B/C, Phase 3 Implementation wave, Phase 3b Debug evidence, Phase 4 Cross-package verification, Phase 5 Multi-reviewer A/B/C, Phase 5 Code-review escalation. Six are review/audit templates (SEVERITY mandatory); four are build/research (SEVERITY omitted); Code-review escalation is a single-specialist review (SEVERITY mandatory).
- All 7 clarify wizard banks in `references/clarify-questions.md` rewritten to the 4-section contract: Universal preamble, feature, fix, refactor, revamp/redesign, debug, research.
- The escalation reviewer in `references/review-and-verify.md` rewritten to the 7-section contract.
- `skills/hackify/SKILL.md` adds two short cross-references pointing readers at the Template Contract and the Wizard Contract; no other content drift.

### Migration notes (for users running 0.1.2)

- Existing in-flight work-docs need no migration — the workflow shape is unchanged.
- Custom sub-agent prompts in user projects can adopt the 7-section contract incrementally. Running `bash scripts/validate-dod.sh` from the plugin source after editing surfaces the same checks the plugin's own templates pass.

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- `marketplace.json` plugin source switched from `github` type (which delegates to the user's local git protocol — SSH by default for many setups) to the explicit `url` type with an HTTPS clone URL. Public-repo HTTPS clones need no SSH key or GitHub auth, so the plugin now installs for any user who can `git clone https://github.com/nadyshalaby/hackify.git` from their machine. Resolves "Permission denied (publickey)" install errors on machines without GitHub SSH access.

### Added

- README "Troubleshooting" section covering the three most common install failures: source-type rejection (fixed in 0.1.1), SSH host-key prompts (one-liner with `ssh-keyscan`), and SSH auth errors (the protocol switch shipped in 0.1.2).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- `marketplace.json` `plugins[0].source` was set to the bare string `"."`, which the current Claude Code plugin-marketplace schema rejects with "This plugin uses a source type your Claude Code version does not support." Replaced with the documented typed-object form `{"source": "github", "repo": "nadyshalaby/hackify"}`. `/plugin install hackify@hackify-marketplace` now succeeds against the published GitHub repo.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-11

### Added

- Initial public release.
- Single skill `hackify` invokable as `/hackify:hackify` after install.
- Six-phase workflow: Clarify → Plan + Gate → Spec self-review → Implement (parallel waves) → Verify → Review (parallel reviewers) → Finish.
- Per-task markdown work-doc convention at `<project>/docs/work/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`.
- Nine reference files covering: clarify question banks, code rules, debug playbook, finish protocol, frontend-design heuristics, TDD walkthrough, parallel-agent dispatch templates, review checklist, work-doc template.
- Optional `evals/evals.json` for use with the `skill-creator` plugin (harmless if not installed).
- Self-hosted marketplace metadata in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so the plugin is installable via `/plugin marketplace add nadyshalaby/hackify` → `/plugin install hackify@hackify-marketplace`.

## Maintenance notes

- **Every release MUST bump `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.** Claude Code uses that field to detect updates for installed users — pushing further commits without a version bump is invisible to existing installs.
- Pair every `version` bump with a new entry in this CHANGELOG and a corresponding git tag (`v0.x.y`).
- Breaking workflow changes (e.g., a renamed phase, a removed reference file, a different work-doc schema) bump the minor version while the plugin is on `0.x.y`, and the major version once it reaches `1.0.0`.
