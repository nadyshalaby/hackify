# Test Scenario Catalog (Canonical)

The canonical catalog of test scenarios hackify's testing wave proves breadth against. Every entry carries a stable ID that every other surface keys on. Loaded on demand by: the Phase 3 testing-wave agent under `test-authoring` (before authoring tests for the categories its round touched), Phase 5 Reviewer B (re-judging every `test.edge-cases` finding), the merged all-lens reviewer at its quality pass, law-scout's semantic tier, and lawkeeper's Testing category.

**Canonical direction.** THIS file is canonical, and nothing restates it elsewhere. The per-category table in `skills/hackify/references/implement-and-test.md` names WHICH domains apply to which code category; it does not restate what a domain checks for, why it matters, or how a test for it must be shaped, those rows live here and only here, the same discipline `rules/performance.md` holds for its own violation rows.

## How to load this file

The catalog is deliberately deep, every row carries why it matters, how to detect the gap, and the shape the test must take, because a coverage finding without those is not actionable. That depth costs tokens, so load by role rather than reading the whole file by reflex:

| Who | What to load |
|---|---|
| **Phase 3 testing-wave agent (`test-authoring`)** | the severity model + ID scheme above, plus only the domains the per-category table in `skills/hackify/references/implement-and-test.md` names for the code category in front of it. A wave testing a pure formatter does not need the authz or concurrency domains. |
| **Phase 5 Reviewer B** | the whole catalog. It re-judges every `test.edge-cases` finding, so it needs every domain and every test shape. |
| **law-scout / lawkeeper's semantic tier** | nothing from here at scan time; it cites these IDs in its own finding rows, it does not read these rows. |
| **Anyone else** | nothing. This catalog is on-demand only, come here to cite an ID or read a test shape, never preloaded. |

Domain sections: Boundary values · Invalid & malformed input · Empty, duplicate & oversized collections · Concurrency & idempotency · Authorization & permission denial · Error propagation & partial failure · State transitions & lifecycle · External non-determinism.

## Severity model

| Severity | Meaning | Classes it covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical (C)** | The scenario's absence ships a defect that loses money, leaks data across a permission boundary, or corrupts state silently. | Cross-tenant and privilege-escalation authz gaps, concurrent-writer and duplicate-request gaps on money/state-changing paths, money/ledger precision and duplicate-entry gaps, dependency-failure partial-state gaps. |
| **Important (I)** | A real, recoverable defect ships. | Boundary and off-by-one gaps, invalid-input handling gaps, collection edge gaps, out-of-order events, lifecycle transition gaps, error-shape and retry-exhaustion gaps. |
| **Minor (M)** | A coverage gap, not a live risk. | Encoding edges and unseeded randomness on logic with no real stakes riding on the outcome. |

Severity in the tables below is the **default**. Context moves it one level: an Important gap on an internal admin form may fall to Minor; a Minor encoding gap inside a billing-address field may rise. The semantic tier stages findings with the default; Reviewer B sets the final severity.

## ID scheme

IDs are stable slugs `test.<domain>.<slug>`. The testing-wave agent's coverage report, law-scout's semantic-tier findings, the Phase 5 decision table, and lawkeeper's catalog all cite them. Renaming an ID is a breaking change to every surface that cites it, extend, do not rename.

## Boundary values (`test.boundary.*`)

| ID | Scenario | Sev | Why it matters | Detect (hint) | Test shape (what the test must show) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test.boundary.zero-and-one | The smallest legal input: zero, empty, or exactly one | I | Off-by-one errors cluster at the edges, not in the middle of the range | A range/count/limit parameter with no fixture at 0 or 1 | Assert behavior AT the boundary, not a value comfortably inside it |
| test.boundary.max-and-overflow | The largest legal value, and one step past it | I (C on a spending cap, rate limit, or quota) | The "+1 past the cap" is exactly where a limit silently stops enforcing | A cap/quota/limit with every fixture sitting comfortably under it | One fixture at the cap asserted accepted, one just past it asserted rejected |
| test.boundary.negative-and-signed | A negative number where the domain assumes non-negative | I | A silent sign error corrupts totals and indexes instead of failing loudly | Numeric input with no negative-value fixture | A negative input asserted rejected or explicitly handled, never silently coerced |
| test.boundary.precision | Floating-point or rounding edges on money or percentages | C on money paths | Cent-level drift compounds silently across a ledger | Currency/rate arithmetic exercised only by integer-clean fixtures | A fixture that does not divide evenly, asserting the exact rounded result the plan specifies |

## Invalid & malformed input (`test.invalid.*`)

| ID | Scenario | Sev | Why it matters | Detect (hint) | Test shape (what the test must show) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test.invalid.wrong-type | A value of the wrong type or shape reaching a boundary | I | The first thing a buggy or adversarial caller sends | A parser/handler with no wrong-shape fixture | Assert a named rejection, not an uncaught crash |
| test.invalid.malformed-structured | Malformed JSON/CSV/structured payloads | I | Real integrations send truncated or corrupt payloads, not merely wrong ones | A deserializer exercised only by well-formed fixtures | A truncated or corrupt fixture asserted to fail closed |
| test.invalid.injection-shaped | Strings shaped like SQL/HTML/shell/path-traversal payloads | C on any boundary reaching a query, shell, or renderer | This is the exact path adversarial input takes in production | A query-builder/renderer/file-path function with no hostile-string fixture | A fixture carrying the injection shape, asserting it is neutralized, not merely that nothing crashed |
| test.invalid.encoding-edge | Unicode, emoji, right-to-left text, null bytes | M/I | Breaks length limits, sorting, and string-boundary logic silently | String-processing logic exercised only by ASCII fixtures | A multi-byte/RTL fixture through the same assertion the ASCII fixture uses |

## Empty, duplicate & oversized collections (`test.collection.*`)

| ID | Scenario | Sev | Why it matters | Detect (hint) | Test shape (what the test must show) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test.collection.empty | The empty list, map, or string case | I | The single most common untested case in list-processing code | A function iterating a collection with no empty-input fixture | Assert the DEFINED behavior on empty input, not whatever the code happens to fall through to |
| test.collection.single-item | Exactly one element, where the logic assumes "first" and "last" differ | I | Off-by-one between first, last, and "the only one" | Pagination/sort/dedup logic with no single-item fixture | Assert the first-item and last-item logic agree with each other on this case |
| test.collection.duplicate-entries | Duplicate keys or values where uniqueness is assumed | I (C where duplicates corrupt a total or an identity) | Silent duplicate handling is a common source of double-charging and double-counting bugs | An aggregation/dedup/upsert path with no duplicate-input fixture | A fixture carrying a real duplicate, asserting the counted or collapsed result |
| test.collection.oversized | A collection at or past a documented limit (pagination, batch size, payload cap) | I | The shape most likely handled only by the small, happy-path fixture | A bounded operation where every fixture sits comfortably under the bound | A fixture sized at and past the bound, asserting the bound is enforced rather than silently ignored |

## Concurrency & idempotency (`test.concurrency.*`)

| ID | Scenario | Sev | Why it matters | Detect (hint) | Test shape (what the test must show) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test.concurrency.duplicate-request | The same request or event replayed or retried (network retry, double-click, at-least-once delivery) | C on money/state-changing paths | A retried write with no idempotency check double-applies | A mutating endpoint/handler with no replay fixture | Send the same request twice, assert the effect happened once |
| test.concurrency.concurrent-writers | Two writers racing on the same resource | C on shared counters, balances, seat/inventory holds | The classic lost-update problem | A read-modify-write path with no concurrent-caller fixture | Two concurrent calls against the same row/key, asserting the final state is consistent, never last-write-silently-wins |
| test.concurrency.out-of-order | Events or messages arriving out of send order | I | Queues and webhooks do not guarantee order | A state machine or sequence-dependent handler exercised only by in-order fixtures | Feed events out of order, assert the same end state or an explicit rejection of the stale one |

## Authorization & permission denial (`test.authz.*`)

| ID | Scenario | Sev | Why it matters | Detect (hint) | Test shape (what the test must show) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test.authz.denied-path-untested | Every guarded action tested for ALLOW, never for DENY | C | An authz check nobody tests failing is a check nobody has proven exists | A permission/guard/role check with no fixture asserting the rejected case | The same action, unauthorized actor, asserting the specific rejection, not merely "not 200" |
| test.authz.cross-tenant | One tenant/account/user reaching another's data via an ID swap | C | The canonical multi-tenant data leak | Any lookup-by-ID endpoint with no fixture substituting a foreign ID | Authenticated as tenant A, request tenant B's resource ID, assert rejection rather than a 404-shaped existence leak |
| test.authz.privilege-escalation | A lower-privilege actor attempting a higher-privilege action | C | A permission ladder proven only at its top rung is unproven at every rung below it | A role-gated mutation with no fixture from the lower role | Call the same mutation as the lower role, assert rejection |

## Error propagation & partial failure (`test.error.*`)

| ID | Scenario | Sev | Why it matters | Detect (hint) | Test shape (what the test must show) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test.error.dependency-failure | A downstream dependency throws, times out, or returns malformed data mid-operation | C on multi-step writes | This is exactly where partial state gets left behind | A multi-step operation with no fixture forcing a mid-sequence failure | Force step N to fail, assert steps 1..N-1 are rolled back or compensated, never left half-applied |
| test.error.error-shape | The shape of the error actually reaching the caller | I | A caller that pattern-matches on error shape breaks silently if the shape drifts | An error path whose only fixture checks "it threw" | Assert the specific error type/code/message contract, not just that something was thrown |
| test.error.retry-exhaustion | Every retry attempt fails | I | The given-up path is usually the least tested one | Retry logic exercised only by a fixture where the Nth attempt succeeds | Force every attempt to fail, assert the terminal error or fallback behavior |

## State transitions & lifecycle (`test.lifecycle.*`)

| ID | Scenario | Sev | Why it matters | Detect (hint) | Test shape (what the test must show) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test.lifecycle.invalid-transition | An attempted transition the state machine should refuse (cancel a completed order, reactivate a deleted account) | I (C on billing/security-relevant state) | An accepted illegal transition corrupts the model's own invariants, and every downstream reader inherits the corruption silently | A state machine tested only on the valid path | Attempt the illegal transition, assert it is refused, not silently accepted or silently ignored |
| test.lifecycle.terminal-re-entry | An action repeated after reaching a terminal state (double-submit after success, double-refund) | C on money/irreversible actions | A terminal state with no repeat guard is a double-refund or a double-fulfillment waiting for a retry to trigger it | A terminal-state action with no fixture repeating it | Reach the terminal state, repeat the action, assert no second effect |

## External non-determinism (`test.external.*`)

| ID | Scenario | Sev | Why it matters | Detect (hint) | Test shape (what the test must show) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| test.external.unseeded-clock | Logic depending on "now," tested only at the moment the test happened to run | I | Passes today, breaks at a month/year/DST boundary | Date/time logic with no frozen-clock fixture | Freeze the clock at a real boundary (midnight, month-end, DST change, year-end) and assert the behavior there |
| test.external.unseeded-random | Logic depending on randomness with no seeded fixture | M/I | Flaky or unfalsifiable tests | A function consuming a randomness source with a fixture that cannot fail because it never pins the output | Inject or seed the randomness source and assert a specific outcome |

## When NOT to force a scenario

This catalog sets a floor for the domains the shipped code actually touches, never a mandate to invent edge-case code paths nobody asked for.

- **Not every domain applies to every unit.** A pure formatting helper has no authz domain to test against; a single-caller batch job has no concurrency domain worth inventing.
- **A property already proven at a lower layer is not re-proven at every layer above it.** If a shared validator's boundary behavior is already covered where it is defined, the caller three layers up does not re-derive that same coverage.
- **`n/a` is a legitimate disposition, a fabricated test is not.** Where a domain genuinely does not apply, the coverage report says so with a one-line reason. A test written just to check a box, with nothing real to assert, is worse than the gap it claims to close.
- **Context sets severity, same as performance.** A coverage gap on an internal admin script tolerates what a public payment endpoint cannot.
