# Security Violation Catalog (Canonical)

The canonical catalog of security violations hackify scans for. Every entry carries a stable ID that every other surface keys on. Loaded on demand by: Phase 3 implementers (before touching auth, permission boundaries, or any external-input boundary), Phase 5 Reviewer A (security), the Phase 5 escalation specialist when the lens it is dispatched on is security, the merged all-lens reviewer at its security pass, and lawkeeper's security category.

**Canonical direction.** THIS file is canonical with no always-on distillation counterpart (unlike the `rules/hard-caps.md`/`rules/code-quality.md` or `rules/performance.md`/`rules/perf-guardrails.md` pairs), joining `rules/performance.md` and `rules/test-scenarios.md` as this repo's three deep, on-demand-only catalogs.

## How to load this file

The catalog is deliberately deep, every row carries why it hurts, how to detect it, and the fix direction, because a finding without those is not actionable. That depth costs tokens, so load by role rather than reading the whole file by reflex:

| Who | What to load |
|---|---|
| **Phase 3 implementer** | the **severity model + ID scheme above, plus only the domain sections your task's surface actually touches** (auth, authz, injection, ...). A task adding a read-only reporting endpoint does not need the crypto or supply-chain domains. |
| **Phase 5 Reviewer A / security lens** | the whole catalog. It judges every candidate and hunts what nothing else catches, so it needs every domain and every fix direction. |
| **lawkeeper's security category** | nothing from here at scan time; it cites these IDs in its own rows, it does not restate them. |
| **Anyone else** | nothing from here by default. This catalog is on-demand only; cite an ID or read a fix direction only when pointed at one. |

Domain sections: Authentication · Authorization · Injection · Secrets & PII · Migrations · Concurrency · CORS & SSRF · Cryptography · Supply chain · Error handling.

## Severity model

<!-- WORDING CONSTRAINT on the Important row below, recorded because nothing else records it.

     Validator check [95] pairs a quoted phrase with a nearby claim word, then asks whether that
     phrase is present elsewhere in the tree. Its claim vocabulary is NEGATIVE only, so the
     positive tag wording below forms no pair, while the negated one-word form of it does: run
     that check's own pairing function over this row worded either way and the negated one
     returns the second cookie flag name as the subject of a false absence claim, which reds the
     gate. The window and the measurements defending it live in that check's own header.

     So keep the two cookie flag names and the mutable-tag clause apart, and keep that clause
     positive. Do not weaken check [95] to buy the wording back. -->

| Severity | Meaning | Classes it covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical (C)** | Ships exploitable risk, data loss, or silently broken auth/authz. | IDOR reachable by an authenticated user, SQL/command injection, a fail-open error branch on a guarded action, a fail-open authorization check, credential/secret exposure, a destructive migration with no guard. |
| **Important (I)** | Weakens security posture without itself being exploitable. | Missing rate limit on a sensitive endpoint, missing `SameSite`/`Secure` cookie flags, a GitHub Action pinned by tag instead of commit SHA, a reflected-origin CORS policy with no allowlist. |
| **Minor (M)** | Hygiene. | PII in a log line that should be hashed, a `validate` helper that only allowlist-filters, a loose dependency version range with no known exploit. |

Severity in the tables below is the **default**. Context moves it one level: a Minor finding on an internal admin tool may fall further; an Important finding on a path already reachable by an unauthenticated caller rises. Reviewer A sets the final severity.

## ID scheme

IDs are stable slugs `sec.<domain>.<slug>`, the same convention as `perf.<domain>.<slug>`. Phase 5 Reviewer A's findings, the Phase 5 decision table, and lawkeeper's catalog all cite them. Renaming an ID is a breaking change to every surface that cites it, extend, do not rename.

## Authentication

Grounded in OWASP Top 10:2025 A07:2025 (Authentication Failures, renamed from "Identification and Authentication Failures") and CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function).

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.auth.no-auth-on-critical-function | A sensitive function (admin action, internal API, funds transfer) is reachable with no authentication check at all | C | Anonymous, unauthenticated access to something that assumes a logged-in identity; CWE-306 (Missing Authentication for Critical Function), OWASP A07:2025 | endpoint/handler wired with no auth middleware/decorator at all, not even a weak one | Require authentication before the handler runs; treat "no auth" as a deploy-blocking gap, not a TODO |
| sec.auth.token-in-browser-storage | Session token or JWT kept in `localStorage`/`sessionStorage` instead of an `HttpOnly` cookie | I | Any script-injection bug becomes full token theft; OWASP A07:2025 | `localStorage.setItem`/`sessionStorage.setItem` on a token/JWT variable | `HttpOnly` + `Secure` + `SameSite` cookie; keep the token out of JS-readable storage |
| sec.auth.weak-logout-invalidation | Logout clears the client cookie but the server-side session/token stays valid | C | A captured token or a shared-device session survives "logout" indefinitely; OWASP A07:2025 | logout handler with no server-side session delete / token-revocation call | Invalidate server-side on logout: delete the session row or add the token to a revocation list |
| sec.auth.session-fixation | A pre-authentication session ID is reused after login instead of rotated | C | Attacker who plants or learns the ID before login inherits the authenticated session; OWASP A07:2025 | session ID unchanged across the login call; no regenerate/cycle call at auth success | Issue a fresh session ID (or token) at the moment authentication succeeds |
| sec.auth.missing-mfa-sensitive-action | No step-up authentication before a sensitive action (email change, payout destination, password change) | I | A stolen primary credential alone is then enough for account takeover; OWASP A07:2025 | sensitive-action handler with only the standing session check, no fresh-auth/step-up gate | Require re-authentication or a second factor immediately before the sensitive action |
| sec.auth.weak-reset-token | Password-reset token with low entropy or a long/no expiry | C | A guessable or long-lived reset token is brute-forceable or interceptable, direct account takeover; OWASP A07:2025 | reset token built from a short/predictable value (timestamp, sequential ID); no expiry check at redemption | CSPRNG token of sufficient length, single-use, short expiry, invalidated on redemption |

## Authorization

Grounded in OWASP Top 10:2025 A01:2025 (Broken Access Control, #1, now also absorbing SSRF), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), and OWASP API Security Top 10:2023 #1 (Broken Object Level Authorization) and #3 (Broken Object Property Level Authorization).

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.authz.idor | An ID-keyed resource is fetched or mutated with no check that the caller owns it | C | Any authenticated user can read or write another user's data by changing an ID; CWE-639 (IDOR), OWASP API Security Top 10:2023 #1 Broken Object Level Authorization | handler reads a path/body ID and queries by it with no `WHERE owner_id = current_user` (or equivalent) clause | Scope every ID-keyed lookup to the caller's own ownership/tenant before it touches the ID |
| sec.authz.missing-route-guard | A new route/endpoint ships with no auth/permission middleware where sibling routes on the same resource have one | C | The one unguarded door in a guarded hallway; CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), OWASP A01:2025 Broken Access Control | new route registration with no guard/middleware decorator that its siblings carry | Apply the same guard middleware/decorator the sibling routes use |
| sec.authz.mass-assignment | A write handler assigns a whole request body onto the record, including fields a role should not set (`role`, `isAdmin`, `balance`) | C | A caller escalates privilege or forges state by sending fields nobody meant to expose; OWASP API Security Top 10:2023 #3 Broken Object Property Level Authorization | `Object.assign(record, req.body)` / ORM `.update(req.body)` with no field allowlist | Allowlist the specific fields the caller's role may set; never spread the raw body onto the model |
| sec.authz.wrong-object-scope-nested | A nested resource path (`/orgs/:orgId/projects/:projectId`) checks authorization against the wrong segment | C | The outer ID passes the guard while the inner one is never re-checked, reaching another org's or user's nested resource; CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization) | guard reads `orgId` for the permission check but the query/mutation runs against `projectId` with no re-check that it belongs to `orgId` | Re-verify ownership at every segment the path names, not only the first |
| sec.authz.improper-scope | An authorization check exists but is evaluated at a coarser granularity than the action needs (route-level only, not the specific record or field) | I | A caller cleared for the endpoint in general reaches a specific record or field the check never actually inspected; CWE-284 (Improper Access Control) | a single role/route check gates every record the handler can reach, with no per-record check inside | Check authorization at the same granularity as the data being touched, not one level above it |

## Injection

Grounded in OWASP Top 10:2025 A05:2025 (Injection), CWE-89 (SQL Injection, #2 in the 2025 CWE Top 25), CWE-79 (XSS, #1 in the 2025 CWE Top 25), CWE-78/CWE-77 (OS Command Injection), CWE-94 (Code Injection), and CWE-22 (Path Traversal).

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.injection.sql-string-concat | SQL built by string concatenation/interpolation of user input | C | Arbitrary query execution, the canonical breach vector; OWASP A05:2025 Injection, CWE-89 | `"SELECT ... " + input` / an f-string or template literal building a query | Parameterized queries / prepared statements / a query builder that binds values |
| sec.injection.command-injection | A shell command built from user input and executed via a shell | C | Arbitrary command execution on the host; OWASP A05:2025 Injection, CWE-78/CWE-77 | `exec`/`system`/backticks with interpolated user input | Avoid a shell entirely (argv-array style execution); if unavoidable, allowlist and escape strictly |
| sec.injection.path-traversal | A file path built from an unvalidated user-supplied segment | C | `../` segments escape the intended directory to read or write arbitrary files; OWASP A05:2025 Injection, CWE-22 | `path.join(baseDir, userInput)` (or equivalent) with no normalization/containment check | Resolve the final path and verify it stays inside the allowed base directory; reject `..` segments |
| sec.injection.unescaped-output-xss | User-controlled data written into an HTML/template context without escaping | C | Stored or reflected script execution in another user's browser, session/token theft follows; OWASP A05:2025 Injection, CWE-79 | `innerHTML =` / unescaped template interpolation / `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` fed by user input | Escape on output by context (HTML/attribute/JS/URL), or use the framework's auto-escaping template path |
| sec.injection.dynamic-code-eval | `eval`/`Function`/dynamic "compile a string" execution of user-controlled input | C | Arbitrary code execution in the process; OWASP A05:2025 Injection, CWE-94 | `eval(`, `new Function(`, or a template-engine "compile string" call fed by user input | Never execute user-controlled strings as code; use data-only parsing (JSON, a fixed template set) |

## Secrets & PII

Grounded in CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.secrets-pii.hardcoded-secret | A credential, API key, or connection string committed in source | C | Anyone with repo read access (or its history) has the credential; CWE-200 | string literal matching a key/token/connection-string shape in a tracked file | Move to environment/secret-manager config; rotate the exposed credential |
| sec.secrets-pii.unhashed-pii-in-logs | Email, phone, or national-ID logged in plaintext | M | Log aggregators and access grants are broader than the data's sensitivity warrants; CWE-200 | logger call with a raw PII field as an argument | Hash, mask, or omit the PII field; log an opaque user ID instead |
| sec.secrets-pii.client-bundled-key | An API key or secret embedded in client-shipped (browser/mobile) code | C | Anyone who opens the bundle has the key; CWE-200 | secret-shaped literal inside frontend source or the built bundle | Keep the key server-side; proxy the call, or issue short-lived scoped tokens to the client |
| sec.secrets-pii.unfiltered-sensitive-response | An API response returns the full record, sensitive fields included, with no field-level filtering | I | Every caller of the endpoint receives fields the UI never needed and the role should not see; CWE-200 | handler returns the raw ORM entity/row instead of a projected DTO | Project the response to an explicit allowlist of fields per caller role |

## Migrations

No external standard citation, this is established engineering practice for schema-migration safety.

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.migrations.unguarded-destructive-change | A migration drops or renames a column/table with no check for existing consumers | C | Silent, unrecoverable data loss the moment the migration runs | `DROP COLUMN`/`RENAME COLUMN`/`DROP TABLE` with no prior existence/usage check | Guard with an existence check; ship a deprecate-then-drop migration pair across releases |
| sec.migrations.non-idempotent | A migration fails or corrupts state if it is re-run (e.g. after a partial failure) | I | Deploy retries and roll-forward operations turn one failure into a stuck, inconsistent schema | `CREATE`/`INSERT` with no `IF NOT EXISTS` / `ON CONFLICT` guard | Make every statement safe to re-run: existence checks, idempotent upserts |
| sec.migrations.no-reversible-path | A destructive migration ships with no rollback path and no recorded explicit sign-off | C | A bad migration has no way back except a restore, and nobody agreed to accept that risk | destructive migration file with no paired down/reverse migration and no sign-off note | Write the reverse migration, or record an explicit, reviewed sign-off that none is possible |

## Concurrency

No external standard citation, this is established engineering practice for race conditions on security-relevant state.

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.concurrency.toctou-permission-check | A permission check and the action it gates are separated by a window where state can change | C | An attacker races the window to act after the check passed but before the state it checked still holds | `if (hasPermission(...)) { ...later... perform() }` with an await/IO gap between them | Re-check at the moment of action, or make check-and-act one atomic operation |
| sec.concurrency.unsynchronized-quota-write | Concurrent writers update a session, credit, or quota record with no lock or atomic operation | C | Lost updates double-spend a credit or quota, or corrupt session state under simultaneous requests | read-modify-write on a balance/quota field with no `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` / atomic increment / optimistic-lock version | Atomic increment/decrement at the database, or a lock (pessimistic or optimistic) around the read-modify-write |
| sec.concurrency.cache-invalidation-race | A cache invalidation/refresh race briefly serves one tenant's cached data to another | C | Even a brief cross-tenant data leak is a multi-tenancy breach the instant it happens | tenant-scoped cache keyed without the tenant ID, or a refresh window with no tenant-scoped lock | Key every cache entry by tenant; scope invalidation and refresh to that same key |

## CORS & SSRF

Grounded in OWASP Top 10:2025's note that SSRF is now folded into A01:2025 (Broken Access Control), and CWE-918 (SSRF, present in the 2025 CWE Top 25 at rank 22).

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.cors.wildcard-origin-with-credentials | `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` configured alongside `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` | I | Signals a broken model of the credentialed-CORS contract even where a compliant browser rejects the literal combination; one edit away from the exploitable reflected-origin form below | CORS config/middleware setting both headers unconditionally | Name an explicit origin allowlist; never pair a wildcard origin with credentials |
| sec.cors.reflected-origin-no-allowlist | The `Origin` request header is echoed back as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with no allowlist check | C | Any site can make credentialed cross-origin requests and read the authenticated response; OWASP A01:2025 Broken Access Control | CORS middleware setting `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` from `req.headers.origin` directly | Validate `Origin` against an explicit allowlist before reflecting it |
| sec.cors.ssrf-unvalidated-outbound-url | An outbound HTTP fetch is built from a user-supplied URL with no allowlist/deny-list on internal address ranges | C | Reaches internal services, cloud metadata endpoints, and internal-only APIs from a public-facing trigger; CWE-918 (SSRF), OWASP A01:2025 | `fetch(userSuppliedUrl)` / webhook-target / image-proxy call with no host/IP-range validation | Allowlist destination hosts, or resolve and reject internal/link-local/metadata IP ranges before the request |

## Cryptography

Grounded in OWASP Top 10:2025 A04:2025 (Cryptographic Failures) and RFC 7519 (JWT).

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.crypto.jwt-alg-none-or-confusion | JWT verification accepts `alg: none` or does not pin the expected algorithm | C | A forged, unsigned (or wrong-algorithm) token is accepted as valid, full auth bypass; RFC 7519, OWASP A04:2025 | JWT library call with no explicit `algorithms:` allowlist passed to verify | Pin the exact expected algorithm at verification; reject `none` outright |
| sec.crypto.fast-hash-for-password | Passwords hashed with a fast general-purpose hash (MD5/SHA-family) instead of a slow KDF | C | A leaked hash table is crackable at billions of guesses per second instead of thousands; OWASP A04:2025 | `md5(`/`sha256(` (or equivalent) applied directly to a password | bcrypt, scrypt, or argon2 with a modern cost parameter |
| sec.crypto.non-csprng-token | A security token or nonce derived from a non-CSPRNG source (`Math.random`, a seeded/weak RNG) | C | Predictable tokens/nonces can be guessed or replayed; OWASP A04:2025 | `Math.random()` (or a language equivalent) feeding a token/nonce/reset-code value | A cryptographically secure random source (`crypto.randomBytes`, `secrets.token_*`) |
| sec.crypto.hardcoded-encryption-key | An encryption key is hardcoded or otherwise fixed in source/config committed to the repo | C | Anyone with source access can decrypt everything the key protects, including past captured ciphertext; OWASP A04:2025 | key/IV literal passed to a cipher constructor | Load the key from a secret manager/KMS; rotate the exposed key |

## Supply chain

Grounded in OWASP Top 10:2025 A03:2025 (Software Supply Chain Failures), the 2025 category covering compromises occurring within or across the entire ecosystem of software dependencies, build systems, and distribution infrastructure.

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.supply-chain.unpinned-dependency | A dependency declared with a loose SemVer range in a lockfile-backed project | M | The lockfile still pins what CI installs today, but the declared range drifts on the next fresh install/regen with no review; OWASP A03:2025 | `^`/`~`/no-version ranges in the manifest where a lockfile exists | Exact versions in the manifest, or trust the lockfile and pin CI to install from it (frozen-lockfile mode) |
| sec.supply-chain.secret-in-ci-log | A CI step echoes, prints, or logs a secret/credential value | C | CI logs are widely readable and often retained or exported, effectively disclosing the credential; OWASP A03:2025 | `echo $SECRET` / a debug print of an env var carrying a credential | Mark the variable masked/secret in the CI config; never pass secrets through a general-purpose log line |
| sec.supply-chain.unpinned-install-script-ref | A build/install script is pulled from a mutable branch ref instead of a tag or commit SHA | C | Whoever controls that branch controls what your build executes next time; no lockfile-equivalent pin exists for it; OWASP A03:2025 | install/curl-pipe-to-shell or git-dependency reference naming a branch, not a SHA/tag | Pin to an exact commit SHA (or a signed release tag) and update deliberately |
| sec.supply-chain.action-pinned-by-tag | A third-party GitHub Action referenced by a mutable tag (`@v1`) instead of a commit SHA | I | A tag can be moved by the action's publisher, or an attacker who compromises them, to point at different code without your workflow changing; OWASP A03:2025 | `uses: owner/action@v<N>` with no 40-char SHA | Pin `uses:` to the full commit SHA; update the SHA deliberately on review |

## Error handling

Grounded in OWASP Top 10:2025 A10:2025 (Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions), the 2025 category for improper error handling and abnormal condition management.

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| sec.error-handling.swallowed-exception | A caught exception is discarded with no logging and no rethrow | M | The failure vanishes; nobody, including a later security investigation, can see it happened; OWASP A10:2025 | a `catch` block that is empty or logs nothing and does not rethrow | Log with enough context to investigate, and rethrow or handle explicitly, never silently discard |
| sec.error-handling.fail-open | An error/exception path grants access or proceeds as if the check passed | C | The single most dangerous version of this category: the failure IS the bypass; OWASP A10:2025 | `catch`/error branch that returns a pass/continues the guarded action instead of denying | Fail closed: an error in a security check is a denial, never a pass-through |
| sec.error-handling.leaky-error-response | A generic error handler returns a stack trace or internal path to the client | I | Reveals internals (paths, dependency versions, framework details) that make the next attack easier; OWASP A10:2025 | catch-all handler serializing the raw exception/stack into the HTTP response | Return a generic client-facing message; log the detail server-side only |
| sec.error-handling.error-path-skips-authz | An error/exception branch reaches the sensitive operation without the authorization check the happy path performs | C | Structurally the same bypass as fail-open, reached through a different branch; OWASP A10:2025 | an early-return/catch branch that calls the same mutating function the guarded happy path calls, upstream of the guard | Run the authorization check on every path that reaches the operation, not only the happy one |
