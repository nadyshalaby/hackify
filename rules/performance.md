# Performance Violation Catalog (Canonical)

The canonical catalog of performance violations hackify scans for. Every entry carries a stable ID that every other surface keys on. Loaded on demand by: Phase 3 implementers (before touching data access, loops, or hot paths), Phase 5 Reviewer D (performance), the deterministic perf-scout ([skills/hackify/references/perf-scout.md](../skills/hackify/references/perf-scout.md)), lawkeeper's performance category, and the quick mirror.

**Canonical direction.** THIS file is canonical. `rules/perf-guardrails.md` is the tight always-on stub injected on every prompt, distilled FROM this catalog. Note the direction is the INVERSE of the caps pair: for caps, the always-on `rules/hard-caps.md` is canonical and `rules/code-quality.md` is the deep doctrine; for performance, the deep file (this one) is canonical and the always-on file is the distillation.

## How to load this file

The catalog is deliberately deep, every row carries why it hurts, how to detect it, and the fix direction, because a finding without those is not actionable. That depth costs tokens, so load by role rather than reading the whole file by reflex:

| Who | What to load |
|---|---|
| **Phase 3 implementer** | the **severity model + ID scheme above, plus only the domain sections your task actually touches** (data access, algorithmic, frontend, ...). A task adding a list endpoint does not need the bundle or logging domains. |
| **Phase 5 Reviewer D** | the whole catalog. It judges every staged candidate and hunts what greps miss, so it needs every domain and every fix direction. |
| **perf-scout** | nothing from here at scan time; its grep table lives in `skills/hackify/references/perf-scout.md`. It cites these IDs, it does not read these rows. |
| **Anyone else** | the always-on distillation `rules/perf-guardrails.md`, which is already in context. Come here only to cite an ID or read a fix direction. |

Domain sections: Algorithmic · Memory / allocation · Data access / N+1 · Network / API · Async / concurrency · Frontend / rendering · Caching · I/O / serialization · Build / bundle · Process / subprocess · Logging / observability.

## Severity model

| Severity | Meaning | Classes it covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical (C)** | Outage-class. Works in dev, falls over in production. | Unbounded growth (memory, cache, metric series, DOM), N+1 on hot paths, event-loop / request-path blocking, missing pagination on growing data, stampede-class amplification (retry storms, cache stampedes, pool exhaustion). |
| **Important (I)** | Slow-product class. Ships, but wastes latency, bytes, or CPU users pay for. | Wasted parallelism, per-item bulk operations, re-render storms, bundle bloat, avoidable transfer and compute on request paths. |
| **Minor (M)** | Micro-allocation nits and style-level waste. | Fix when touching the line. Never blocks a release on its own. |

Severity in the tables below is the **default**. Context moves it one level: a Minor inside a per-request hot loop rises; a Critical inside a one-off migration script may fall. The scout stages findings with the default; Reviewer D sets the final severity.

## ID scheme

IDs are stable slugs `perf.<domain>.<slug>`. Scout grep tables, staged findings, the Phase 5 decision table, and lawkeeper's catalog all cite them. Renaming an ID is a breaking change to every surface that greps for it, extend, do not rename.

## Async / concurrency

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| perf.async.sync-blocking | Sync I/O, sync crypto, or huge sync parse on a server event loop | C | Blocks ALL in-flight requests, not just this one | `*Sync(` calls, sync hashing, MB-scale `JSON.parse` in handlers | Async APIs; move heavy parse/crypto off the hot path |

## Caching

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| perf.caching.missing-cache | Hot, expensive, repeated computation with no cache | I | The same cycles burned per call (template compile, parse, key derivation) | profiler hot spots called with repeating inputs | Cache by input key, with a bound |

## Process / subprocess

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| perf.process.spawn-per-item | A process spawned per item for work only a process can do, where one invocation covers the whole set | I | fork plus exec is milliseconds of pure overhead per item and it scales with the list, not the work: 360 `wc -l` spawns measured 0.33s against 0.01s for one `xargs wc -l` over the same files | a command substitution, pipe or helper binary inside a per-file / per-token / per-row loop, doing something the interpreter cannot do itself | One invocation over the batch (`xargs`, a pattern file, a single alternation pass), or a batched screen with the per-item loop kept as the fallback. n forks become one; batching costs a loop restructure, so reconcile the batch against the list it was built from, a short batch reports a confident green over files nobody read. Where a builtin replaces the fork outright, that is perf.process.fork-for-builtin instead |
| perf.process.fork-for-builtin | A process spawned per item for work the interpreter already does inline | I | the same fork-plus-exec cost per item as the row above, except that all of it is waste, the answer was already in the process. Measured here, best of three, 307 `$(basename "$f")` spawns took 0.42s against 0.00s for `${f##*/}` over the same list | `$(basename`, `$(dirname`, `$(echo`, `$(expr`, `$(cat` on a single variable, or a helper binary trimming, splitting, measuring or arithmetic-ing one value, inside a per-item loop | The expansion that replaces it outright: `${v##*/}`, `${v%/*}`, `${v//a/b}`, `${#v}`, `$((...))`, `$(<file)`. n forks become ZERO, so unlike the row above the fix is local to the line, needs no batch and no loop restructure, and cannot under-read the set |

## Logging / observability

| ID | Violation | Sev | Why it hurts | Detect (hint) | Fix direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| perf.obs.log-in-hot-loop | Log call per iteration of a hot loop | I | I/O and formatting × n dwarf the loop's real work | logger/print inside tight loops | Log aggregates (counts, samples) outside the loop |
| perf.obs.eager-log-serialization | Serializing big objects in log arguments regardless of level | I | stringify runs even when the level is disabled | `JSON.stringify`/format inside debug/info args | Guard by level, or defer serialization until emit |
| perf.obs.sync-log-transport | Synchronous log transport in the request path | I | Every request pays the disk/network flush | sync file/HTTP transports on request loggers | Async/buffered transport; flush on interval and shutdown |
| perf.obs.metric-cardinality | Unbounded metric label values (user ID, URL, UUID) | C | Time-series count explodes; scrapes slow; cost balloons | dynamic/user-derived label values | Bounded enums as labels; IDs go to logs/traces instead |
| perf.obs.full-sampling | 100% trace sampling on high-QPS paths | I | Trace overhead and storage per request at full rate | always-on sampler in production config | Head/tail sampling at low %; always keep errors |
| perf.obs.debug-in-prod | debug/trace log level enabled in production | I | Every request pays formatting and transport for logs nobody reads | prod config with level below info | info-level default; targeted, temporary debug scopes |

## When NOT to optimize

Performance work obeys the same discipline as everything else, the expert-mindset performance hat: *cheapest-correct beats clever-slow*.

- **Measure before optimizing.** A profile, an EXPLAIN, a bundle report, evidence first. No fix without a number or a clear complexity argument.
- **Correct and simple wins.** Do not trade clarity for an unmeasured micro-gain. `perf.frontend.over-memoization` is in this catalog because premature optimization is itself a violation.
- **No speculative micro-optimization.** The catalog targets structural waste (complexity class, round-trips, unbounded growth), not language golf. Minor entries wait until you touch the line.
- **Context sets severity.** A cold admin script tolerates what a request path cannot. Stage the candidate, judge it in context.
