## Coverage

- Deterministic scan: {{run / which checks}}.
- Semantic pass: {{which concerns ran / linter used for caps / any skipped}}.
- Scope: {{whole tree | subtree path}}. Carve-outs applied: {{summary}}.
- Waivers recorded: {{any maintainer-stated exceptions, or "none"}}.

## Recommended next step

{{One opinionated recommendation per §5.1 — e.g. "Fix the 3 critical secrets first, then the
12 high bans in one batch; defer the low naming findings." Then ask whether to proceed to
remediation (Phase 5), and whether to fix top-down by severity or by file.}}
