# Perf-scout (deterministic performance candidate finder)

A predictable, grep-based scan that surfaces performance-violation **candidates** keyed to the stable IDs in [rules/performance.md](../../../rules/performance.md) (the canonical catalog). Run at fixed points in the workflow, by the wave agent over its own file allowlist and by the parent over the wider scopes; its output feeds the Phase 5 address-all decision table and the round's performance lens, which is the merged reviewer's performance pass by default and Reviewer D when the user has asked for the panel.

## WHAT

- **Deterministic candidate finder.** Same files in, same candidates out, plain `grep`/`awk`, no compiler, no AST, no new dependency. It maps to the shell primitive on every runtime tier.
- **Candidates, not verdicts.** A match means "look here", never "guilty". Judgment lives in the TRIAGE rules below and with the round's performance lens.
- **Keyed to catalog IDs.** Every pattern cites a `perf.<domain>.<slug>` ID from `rules/performance.md`, so staging, default severity, and deduplication stay stable across runs. A pattern with no catalog ID is invalid, extend the catalog first.
- **Cheap by design.** Seconds per run, run it at every mandated point without hesitation.

## WHEN

| Run point | Scope | What happens with findings |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 3, the AGENT, before it returns** | That wave's OWN file allowlist, the files it landed | Trivial in-allowlist candidates are fixed in place (mark `fixed`); everything else is `staged` in the wave report |
| **Phase 3, the PARENT, every round-end** | The round-touched files (what the round's waves DECLARED under `## Paths written`, never the allowlist union), before the round commits, never before a tick | Each wave's dispositions carry forward unchanged; what the wider scope newly shows is `staged` for Phase 5, or sent back out as a one-task wave, a new finding, never an un-tick. The parent never writes the fix |
| **Phase 5, start** | The whole sprint diff (`git diff --name-only <base>..HEAD -- . ':(exclude)docs/work/*'`) | Staging table handed to the round's reviewer as `{{perf_scout_report}}`; `staged` rows join the address-all decision table |
| **quick (5-lite mirror)** | Touched files, before the 5-lite review | Findings resolved in the same pass; that one reviewer carries the performance lens |

**Why the Phase 3 run point is BOTH the wave and the round.** The two scans answer questions the other cannot, so neither replaces it. The AGENT scan is keyed to the wave because that is the only moment fix-in-wave is possible at all: the agent is still holding its files, they sit inside its own allowlist, and a trivial fix lands in the same diff. The PARENT scan is keyed to the round because the round commits once and the parent runs its repo-wide checks once per round, so a parent scan keyed to wave-end would run before the thing it is meant to gate. Ticks are not that thing: they already landed, one at a time as each agent returned, so what this scan raises is a new finding, never an un-tick. Where a round holds two or more waves it also reaches what no agent scan can: the round's declared set is the only scope in which a defect crossing two waves is visible, because no agent can scan a file it never held. **On a single-wave round that scope reason is void**, the round's declared set IS what that one wave declared, and the mandate still holds because two questions survive the collapse. First, whether the agent ran its scan at all: the wave report is a claim, and the parent's own scan is what checks it. Second, whether a fix-in-wave regressed the file after the agent's scan had already passed: a fix-in-wave edit lands AFTER the scan that surfaced the candidate, and nothing at the agent's run point re-reads the file once it has been edited, so the agent's green grades the pre-fix state and the parent's scan is the first read of the post-fix one. Canonical statement of both run points and the loop they sit in: [phases/phase-3-implement.md](phases/phase-3-implement.md).

## HOW

Ground rules for every pattern:

- **POSIX ERE, macOS/BSD-safe.** No `\b`, no `\s`, no `\d`, use `[[:space:]]`, `[0-9]`, explicit classes. Run with `grep -E -n` or `rg -n`.
- **SQL-ish patterns run case-insensitive** (`grep -i -E`), marked per table.
- **Loop-body patterns** need loop context, and the helper that gives it is chosen by LANGUAGE, never by a single window. Shell and Python both terminate a loop unambiguously (`done`, and a dedent), so their bodies are extracted EXACTLY and no window is involved. Brace languages fall back to `loop_window`, whose size is an argument with a measured default.
- **Scope is the diff**, never the whole user repo (lawkeeper owns full-codebase sweeps).

**Why the window stopped being one number, measured rather than argued.** A fixed 6-line window is a guess about how long a loop body is, and the guess is per-language. Over the 386 shell and Python loop bodies in this plugin's own tree (`dist/` and `docs/work/` excluded), 6 lines covers 81%, p95 is 12 and the longest is 38; over its 11 JavaScript bodies, 6 covers 91% and the longest is 11. So 6 was defensible for the language it was calibrated on and lost roughly one shell loop body in three, which is how a scan reports a clean zero over a file it only partly read. Two changes follow. Shell and Python get exact-extent helpers, so their coverage is 100% by construction and the number stops existing. Everything else keeps a window, now a parameter, defaulted to **12**, the p95 of every loop body measured here. Re-derive it for another tree rather than inheriting this one: the `find`-and-`awk` pass that produced these numbers is a `done`-depth counter for shell and an indent counter for Python, and the same two helpers below run it.

```bash
# sh_loop_body <file> <token-ERE>: EXACT shell loop bodies, no window. Emits
# "file:line:loop-header-line:depth:text" for every body line, then filters with
# grep -E, so every pattern in the tables below stays plain POSIX ERE. `depth`
# is the nesting level, and it is what makes perf.algorithmic.nested-loop-join
# mechanical. Heredoc bodies are skipped so a `done` inside one cannot close a
# loop that is still open, and a `<<WORD` counts as an opener only where a
# redirect could sit, never inside a quoted string.
sh_loop_body() {
  awk '
    hd != "" { if ($0 == hd) hd = ""; next }
    /^[[:space:]]*#/ { next }
    # A `<<WORD` ANYWHERE ON THE LINE USED TO OPEN A HEREDOC, inside a quoted
    # string included, and one that never closes blinds the scan in silence.
    # One `echo "cat <<EOF"` set the delimiter, and the rule above then skipped
    # every line down to a bare `EOF`; in a file that never writes one, that is
    # the rest of the file, every loop below it invisible and the report a
    # clean zero. Live in this tree at hooks/test_block_banned_tokens.sh:59,
    # which hid the 239 lines under it, a python3-per-item loop among them.
    # So the delimiter now has to sit where a redirect can sit: at end of line,
    # or before `<`, `>`, `|`, `&`, `;`, `)` or a comment, `2>` counted.
    # POSITION RATHER THAN STRIPPING THE QUOTED SPANS FIRST. A stripper has to
    # carve out the very quotes it strips, since a quoted delimiter is written
    # with them, and reading one line at a time it cannot track a string that
    # runs past the line end; when it desynchronises it fails this same silent
    # way. What survives here is a quoted delimiter that happens to be followed
    # by a pipe or a redirect, `echo "cat <<EOF | wc"`, and that is the residue
    # this trades for: a genuine opener wrongly rejected only scans a heredoc
    # body and costs one disposition, a false one accepted costs the rest of
    # the file.
    # NO APOSTROPHE BELONGS IN THIS COMMENT. The awk program is a single-quoted
    # shell word, so a bare apostrophe here ends it and hands the next run of
    # characters to the shell to split and glob before awk ever sees them. Only
    # the escape the two lines below use is safe.

### Bounded or data, the question every loop-body candidate answers FIRST

A loop over three hand-written rows and a loop over every file in the tree look identical in the body. Only the second one is a performance finding, and a scout that cannot tell them apart makes every future report longer and less useful until agents skim it. **The discriminator is the loop's DRIVER, never its body**, and the driver is mechanical: run `loop_driver` and apply these branches in order, stopping at the first that fires.

| The driver contains | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `$(`, a backtick, `< <(`, or `done <` a file | **data** | The list is produced by a command or a file, so it grows with the input |
| an unquoted glob after `in` | **data** | A directory listing grows |
| `"${NAME[@]}"` and any assignment to `NAME` contains `$(` or a backtick | **data** | The array was filled from a command |
| `"${NAME[@]}"` and every assignment to `NAME` is literal | **bounded** | Hand-written rows, and a `check_list_size`-style pin usually states the count |
| `done <<'TAG'` with a QUOTED delimiter | **bounded** | A quoted heredoc expands nothing, so its body is literal text |
| `done <<TAG` or `<<<"$VAR"` | resolve ONE level | Read the heredoc body or the here-string variable, then re-apply row 1 against its assignment |
| `while [ "$i" -le <integer literal> ]` | **bounded** | A counter with a written bound |
| `in` followed only by literal words | **bounded** | A fixed list |
| anything else | **unknown** | Not a verdict, see the fail-open rule below |

- **Only an explicit `bounded` suppresses. `unknown` never does.** The classification is fail-open toward the finding on purpose: a misread driver then costs one row to disposition, never a missed defect. Measured on this tree's shell, a literal list containing `**SCENARIO**` classified `data` because the glob branch cannot tell a quoted asterisk from an unquoted one. That is the direction to be wrong in.
- **A `bounded` verdict collapses to ONE staging row per pattern**, reading `false-positive: bounded driver, <n> candidates at <file:line>, <file:line>`. This is the single carve-out from the one-row-per-candidate rule in TRIAGE, it is written here so a collapsed row is not read as a candidate that vanished, and the row still names every line it covers.
- **A `bounded` loop whose body is genuinely expensive is still a finding**, it is just not THIS one. Fifty forks over twelve fixed files is a quarter of a second nobody will ever notice; a `sort` of the whole database inside a three-iteration loop is not. Bounded bounds the ITERATION COUNT and says nothing about the work per iteration.

### JS/TS (whole-file patterns)

| Pattern (ERE) | Catalog ID | Notes / false-positive guard |
|---|---|---|
| `JSON\.parse\(JSON\.stringify\(` | perf.memory.json-deep-clone | The call is the finding. Fix: `structuredClone` or clone the mutated slice. |
| `\.forEach\([[:space:]]*async` | perf.async.await-in-loop | forEach never awaits its callback, also a perf.async.fire-and-forget candidate. |
| `Promise\.all\([[:space:]]*[A-Za-z_$][A-Za-z0-9_$.]*\.map\(` | perf.async.unbounded-fanout | Fine when the list is constant-size; flag data-sized lists. Same for `Promise\.allSettled\(`, run both. |
| `[A-Za-z]+Sync\(` | perf.async.sync-blocking | Also perf.io.sync-fs. CLI scripts, startup, and tests are fine, flag request/handler paths. |
| `new[[:space:]]+Map\(` | perf.memory.unbounded-cache | Candidate when module-scope AND written from handlers with no `.delete`/`.clear`/TTL. Run `new[[:space:]]+Set\(` too. |
| `=\{\{` | perf.frontend.unstable-props | JSX inline object prop. Cheap on plain DOM leaves; matters for memoized children and hot lists. |
| `=\{\[` | perf.frontend.unstable-props | JSX inline array prop, same guard as above. |
| `=\{\([[:space:]A-Za-z_$,]*\)[[:space:]]*=>` | perf.frontend.unstable-props | JSX inline lambda prop, same guard as above. |
| `key=\{index\}` | perf.frontend.index-key | Variants: `key=\{i\}`, `key=\{idx\}`. Confirm the identifier is the map index, not an entity id. |
| `addEventListener\(` | perf.memory.leaked-listeners | Confirm a paired `removeEventListener` in cleanup. scroll/resize/mousemove/input handlers doing real work → perf.frontend.unthrottled-handlers. |
| `setInterval\(` | perf.memory.leaked-listeners | Confirm a paired `clearInterval`. Polling an endpoint on interval → perf.network.polling-vs-push. |
| `\.subscribe\(` | perf.memory.leaked-listeners | Store the subscription and dispose it on teardown. |
| `from[[:space:]]+['"]lodash['"]` | perf.bundle.whole-library-import | Whole-lib default/namespace import. Repeat the pattern for other heavy libs (moment, rxjs, date-fns). Per-module paths are the fix. |
| `JSON\.stringify` | perf.obs.eager-log-serialization | Flag when inside log-call arguments (runs even when the level is off). MB-scale graphs per request → perf.io.sync-serialize-large. |
| `\.\.\.acc` | perf.algorithmic.spread-accumulator | Accumulator spread inside reduce/loop. Variants: `\.\.\.prev`, `\.\.\.result`, `\.\.\.out`. |
| `OFFSET[[:space:]]+` (with `-i`) | perf.data.deep-offset | Also `\.offset\(` and `skip[[:space:]]*:` in ORM query builders. Fixed small offsets are fine; parametric page math is not. |

### JS/TS, loop-body patterns (run through `loop_window`, the 12-line fallback)

| Pattern (ERE) | Catalog ID | Notes / false-positive guard |
|---|---|---|
| `await[[:space:]]` | perf.async.await-in-loop | Dependent iterations (each needs the previous result) are legitimately serial. |
| `\.find[A-Za-z]*\(` | perf.data.n-plus-one | ORM/repository receiver → n-plus-one. Array receiver → perf.algorithmic.scan-in-loop instead. |
| `\.query\(` | perf.data.n-plus-one | Reads per item. Batch with JOIN / `IN (...)` / dataloader. |
| `\.save\(` | perf.data.per-item-write | Also `\.create\(`, `\.insert[A-Za-z]*\(`, `\.update[A-Za-z]*\(`, bulk APIs are the fix. |
| `fetch\(` | perf.network.chatty-calls | Any HTTP client call in a loop maps the same (axios/got/request). Retry wrappers are not chatty-calls. |
| `\.includes\(` | perf.algorithmic.scan-in-loop | Bounded constant lists are fine; data-sized collections need a Set/Map. Run `\.indexOf\(` too. |
| `\.sort\(` | perf.algorithmic.sort-in-loop | Sort once before the loop. |
| `\.u?n?shift\(` | perf.algorithmic.shift-in-loop | Matches `.shift(` and `.unshift(`. Tiny bounded queues are fine; hot loops are not. |
| `\+=[[:space:]]*['"]` | perf.algorithmic.string-concat-loop | Also flag `+=` where the LHS accumulates strings (template literals included). Numeric accumulators are fine. |
| `new[[:space:]]+RegExp\(` | perf.algorithmic.regex-in-loop | A pattern that genuinely changes per item is legitimate, hoist only invariant ones. |
| `console\.` | perf.obs.log-in-hot-loop | Logger calls (`logger.info/debug`) count too. Tooling loops over a handful of items are usually fine, hot data loops are not. |

### Python

Every row marked `(loop-window)` below now runs through **`py_loop_body`** instead, which bounds the body by indentation and needs no window at all. The bounded-or-data rule applies here too, read off the `for`/`while` header: a literal list, a tuple constant or `range(<integer literal>)` is bounded; a call, a file handle, `os.walk`, a comprehension over a query, or a parameter is data.

| Pattern (ERE) | Catalog ID | Notes / false-positive guard |
|---|---|---|
| `json\.loads\(json\.dumps\(` | perf.memory.json-deep-clone | Use `copy.deepcopy`, or build the new shape directly. |
| `\.objects\.` (loop-window) | perf.data.n-plus-one | Django ORM per item, `select_related`/`prefetch_related`/`in_bulk`. Lazy FK attribute access in loops counts too. |
| `session\.` (loop-window) | perf.data.n-plus-one | SQLAlchemy per-item query/get, batch with `in_()`. |
| `cursor\.execute\(` (loop-window) | perf.data.per-item-write | `executemany` / bulk insert is the fix. |
| `time\.sleep\(` | perf.async.sleep-poll | Candidate when inside a `while` condition-wait. Backoff inside a retry helper is legitimate. |
| `requests\.` | perf.async.sync-blocking | Candidate when inside `async def`, use an async client (httpx/aiohttp). Sync scripts are fine. |
| `\+=[[:space:]]*f?['"]` (loop-window) | perf.algorithmic.string-concat-loop | `''.join(parts)` is the fix. |
| `re\.compile\(` (loop-window) | perf.algorithmic.regex-in-loop | Note: bare `re.match/search` auto-caches up to 512 patterns, weak candidate; still hoist hot ones. |
| `lru_cache\(maxsize=None\)` | perf.caching.unbounded-memo-args | Also `@(functools\.)?cache`. Bounded arg spaces (enums) are fine; user-derived args are not. |
| `\.read\(\)` | perf.io.whole-file-read | Small config files are fine; uploads/exports/logs iterate chunks or lines. |
| `pd\.concat\(` (loop-window) | perf.memory.buffer-concat-loop | Collect frames in a list, concat once. DataFrame `.append` in loops maps the same. |
| `[[:space:]]in[[:space:]]+\[` (loop-window) | perf.algorithmic.scan-in-loop | Membership against a literal list per iteration, use a set. `x in some_list` variants need type knowledge (semantic). |
| `global[[:space:]]+[a-z_]` | perf.memory.global-accumulator | Candidate when mutated inside request handlers; bounded module registries are fine. |

### Shell (run through `sh_loop_body`, then classify the driver)

Added after a Phase 5 round found this repo spending roughly 15% of its own pre-commit gate here with
no catalog ID to file it under. The scout's ground rule is that every pattern cites a real ID, and for
two rounds this family had none, so findings were filed under an ID that did not exist.

**These rows are derived from what this tree's own shell does at scale, not imported from a generic list.** Two families with no instance anywhere in it were considered and LEFT OUT rather than added on faith: a `>>` append redirect per item (`perf.io.unbatched-writes`, measured zero) and a `sleep` inside a condition-wait (`perf.async.sleep-poll`, measured zero). Add either the day the shape appears.

**These rows did not fire before, and the reason was the loop header, not the window.** The retired `loop_window` header ERE matched `while (`, the C-style form. Shell writes `while IFS= read -r f; do`, with no parenthesis, so every `while` loop in every shell file was invisible at any window size, and in this tree the data-driven loops are almost all `while read` fed by `find` or `git ls-files`. `for x in ...` matched, which is why the retired pattern found anything at all.

| Pattern (ERE) | Catalog ID | Notes / false-positive guard |
|---|---|---|
| `\$\((basename\|dirname)[[:space:]]` | perf.process.fork-for-builtin | A fork for something the shell already does: `${f##*/}`, `${f%/*}`. n forks become ZERO and the fix is local to the line, which is what separates this row from the one below. `realpath` moved to that row: it resolves symlinks against the filesystem, so no expansion replaces it, but it takes many operands in one call. |
| `\$\((cat\|wc\|grep\|git\|sed\|awk\|find\|sort\|uniq\|head\|tail\|cut\|tr\|stat\|realpath\|date\|jq\|python3\|node)[[:space:]]` | perf.process.spawn-per-item | One invocation over the batch is the fix: `xargs wc -l`, one `grep -f patternfile`, one alternation pass. Measured here, 300 files through a per-item `wc -l \| tr` loop took 0.210s against 0.025s for one `xargs wc -l` over the same list. `$(cat` reading ONE file is perf.process.fork-for-builtin instead, where `$(<file)` replaces it outright. |
| `[|][[:space:]]*(grep\|sed\|awk\|wc\|cut\|tr\|sort\|head\|tail\|jq)[[:space:]]` | perf.process.spawn-per-item | The pipeline form of the row above, and the one the retired `echo \| grep` pattern only caught in its narrowest spelling. |
| (via `sh_accum`) | perf.algorithmic.string-concat-loop | `X="$X..."` or `X+=...` growing a string per iteration. `''.join`-shaped fix is an ARRAY plus one `printf '%s\n' "${a[@]}"`, so `ARR+=(x)` is the fix and never the finding. The helper excludes it, and excludes `${v#x}`/`${v%x}` trims. It strips one `case`-arm prefix first, so `*) X="$X $t" ;;` is reached. |
| same `$(...)` text twice under one loop header | perf.algorithmic.loop-invariant | Sort the `sh_loop_body` output by header and count duplicate substitutions. Exclude `$((`, which is arithmetic and forks nothing. Three `$(basename "$f")` in one body is three forks where one variable does. |
| a spawn in the body that never mentions the loop variable | perf.algorithmic.loop-invariant | Strictly worse than a per-item spawn: the same command runs n times over the same input. Read the loop variable off `loop_driver`'s header, then check the candidate line for it. |
| `depth` field ≥ 2 on any row above | perf.algorithmic.nested-loop-join | `sh_loop_body` prints the nesting depth, so this is a filter on output rather than a pattern. An inner loop multiplies whatever the outer one costs; judge the two drivers together, and a nested pair where BOTH are data is the shape that actually bites. |

**Left out as not mechanical, deliberately.** Whether a spawn sits on a hot path or in a once-per-release script needs reading, and no ERE reaches it; that judgment stays with the disposition. Whether a `grep` per item could become one `grep -f` depends on whether the per-item diagnostic is load-bearing, which this repo has decided BOTH ways in different fragments; the row above stages the candidate and says nothing about the fix. Neither is written as a rule, because a rule only a careful human can apply is noise with a catalog ID attached.

### SQL (run with `grep -i -E`)

| Pattern (ERE) | Catalog ID | Notes / false-positive guard |
|---|---|---|
| `SELECT[[:space:]]+\*` | perf.data.select-star | Migration/introspection scripts excluded; hot queries name their columns. |
| `LIKE[[:space:]]+'%` | perf.data.leading-wildcard | Leading wildcard defeats btree indexes. Trailing-only wildcards (`'x%'`) are fine. |
| `COUNT\(\*\)` | perf.data.count-for-exists | Finding only when the caller tests `> 0` / truthiness, real count displays are legitimate. |
| `OFFSET[[:space:]]+[0-9$:?]` | perf.data.deep-offset | Parametric or deep offsets → keyset. Fixed first-page offsets are fine. |
| `WHERE[[:space:]]+[A-Z_]+\(` | perf.data.missing-index | A function wrapped around a column in WHERE is non-sargable, functional index or rewrite. |
| `LIMIT` (inverted: `grep -L -i`) | perf.data.unbounded-result | Query files containing SELECT but no LIMIT. Aggregates and unique-key lookups are fine. |

### Semantic-only candidates (no reliable grep)

These catalog entries need reading, not pattern-matching, the scout lists them for the performance lens's checklist instead: perf.data.missing-index (needs EXPLAIN), perf.network.sequential-awaits (independence, the awk helper only finds adjacency), perf.network.no-timeout, perf.caching.no-invalidation, perf.caching.stampede, perf.network.duplicate-inflight, perf.frontend.missing-virtualization, perf.memory.retained-payload.

### Stack extension (other languages)

For Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, PHP, and anything else: derive tokens from the **Detect (hint)** column of the catalog, e.g. Go `db.Query` inside `for` → perf.data.n-plus-one; Ruby `Model.find` inside `.each` → the same ID. Keep patterns POSIX-ERE and `[[:space:]]`-safe, and every new pattern MUST cite an ID that already exists in `rules/performance.md`, no ID, no pattern.

## COVERAGE, reconciled before a single finding is read

**A zero from a file no table covers reads exactly like a zero from a clean file, and until this section existed nothing here told the two apart.** The scout had no coverage step at all, which is a real gap and not a theoretical one: the round that found the shell defect reported its zero honestly because the agent was careful, not because anything asked it to. Care is not a mechanism. This is.

Run it BEFORE reading any candidate, over the same path list the run point handed you.

```bash
# scout_coverage <path>..., bucket the scope by what actually has a pattern table.
scout_coverage() {
  cov_t=0; cov_c=0; cov_u=""; cov_x=""
  for cov_f in "$@"; do
    cov_t=$((cov_t + 1))
    [ -r "$cov_f" ] || { cov_x="$cov_x $cov_f"; continue; }
    case "$cov_f" in
      *.js|*.jsx|*.ts|*.tsx|*.mjs|*.cjs|*.py|*.sh|*.bash|*.sql) cov_c=$((cov_c + 1)) ;;
      *) cov_u="$cov_u $cov_f" ;;
    esac
  done
  echo "scope $cov_t | covered by a table $cov_c | no table:$cov_u | unreadable:$cov_x"
}
```

- **The three buckets must add up to the scope.** `covered + no-table + unreadable = scope`. A shortfall means the path list lost entries on the way in, and that is the same class of bug the law-scout's reconcile exists to catch.
- **`no table` is MISSING COVERAGE, never a clean result.** It names files that were in scope and had not one pattern run against them. Every such file gets its own staging row reading `no pattern table for <ext>, coverage lost`, and where the extension is a real language the fix is a new table under Stack extension, cited to an existing catalog ID.
- **`unreadable` is missing coverage too**, and louder, because the file was in scope and expected to be read. Name it and say why (permissions, binary, generated).
- **A markdown-only or JSON-only wave is the common honest case.** Doctrine files carry no loops and no queries, so `covered 0` is the correct answer there, and it goes in the report as `covered 0 of N, no executable file in scope` rather than as `no candidates`. Those two sentences mean opposite things and the report has to be able to say which one happened.
- **The coverage line is MANDATORY in the staging table**, above the rows, even when the table is empty. A report whose only claim is a zero is worth exactly what its coverage line says it is worth.

## STAGING

Stage findings in exactly this table (the AGENT appends it to its own wave report under `## Scout dispositions`, the parent transcribes those rows into the wave log and appends the round-end table beside them, and at review start it goes in the Phase 5 review section):

```markdown
### Perf-scout (<run-point-id>, <YYYY-MM-DD>)

Coverage: scope 9 | covered by a table 7 | no table: docs/api.yaml | unreadable: none

| Finding | Catalog ID | file:line | Evidence | Proposed fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Query per task in export loop | perf.data.n-plus-one | src/export/service.ts:88 | `await repo.findOne(t.id)` inside `for (const t of tasks)` | one `findMany` with `id IN (...)` before the loop | staged |
| `wc -l` per tracked file | perf.process.spawn-per-item | scripts/validate-dod.d/80-file-size-caps.sh:141 | retired body was `loc=$(wc -l < "$f" \| tr -d ' ')` in a `while read`, 2 forks per file; 250 files took 0.45s against 0.03s batched. 141 is the batched `xargs -0 wc -l` that replaced it, which is where a `fixed` row has to point once the defect line is gone | one `xargs -0 wc -l` before the loop | fixed |
| Sync read in request handler | perf.io.sync-fs | src/routes/report.ts:14 | `readFileSync(tplPath)` per request | async read once at startup, reuse | fixed |
| `.includes` in tag loop | perf.algorithmic.scan-in-loop | src/tags.ts:31 | scanned list is 5 static items | , | false-positive: bounded constant list |
| `$(basename)` per item, 4 loops | perf.process.fork-for-builtin | scripts/validate-dod.d/20-templates.sh:156, 161, 164, 194 | drivers at 155, 160, 163 and 193 are `"${PA_BUILD_FILES[@]}"` and `"${PA_REVIEW_SINGLE_FILES[@]}"`, literal arrays pinned at 3 and 9 by `check_list_size` at 146 and 147; each of the four call sites now reads `${f##*/}`, the expansion that replaced the fork | , | false-positive: bounded driver, 4 candidates |
| yaml has no pattern table | , | docs/api.yaml | in scope, no table for `.yaml`, nothing ran against it | add a table or declare the gap | staged: coverage lost |
```

- **`<run-point-id>`** names the run point that produced the table, and it is what tells two tables apart where both sit in one wave log under this same heading grammar: `<wave-id>-agent` for the wave agent's own scan over the files it landed, taking the wave id the Approach's execution-wave plan already assigns (`W9c-agent`); `R<n>-round-end` for the parent's scan over what that round's waves declared (`R9-round-end`); `phase-5` for the sprint-diff scan. Without it the round scan's first question, whether the agent ran its own scan at all, has no answer a reader can read off the log. On a single-wave round the two scopes coincide by construction and the id still earns its place, because the two SCANS do not: run point 1's green graded the pre-fix-in-wave state, and run point 2 is the first read of the post-fix one.
- **Status** is one of `staged` / `fixed` / `false-positive: <one-line reason>`.
- **The coverage line is part of the table, not a preamble to it.** It goes above the rows on every run, including a run with no rows, and a table shipped without it is incomplete in the same way a candidate with no disposition is.
- **Into the Phase 5 decision table** (Finding / Severity / Decision / Evidence): Finding, file:line, and Evidence carry over; Severity is the catalog default for the Catalog ID (the performance lens may move it one level in context); `staged` rows enter as accept-candidates.

## TRIAGE

- **Every candidate gets exactly one disposition**, `staged`, `fixed`, or `false-positive`. A candidate that vanishes without a row is a protocol violation, not a judgment call. The single carve-out is the bounded-driver collapse above, which gives n candidates one shared row that names every one of them, so nothing vanishes there either.
- **A zero is a claim about coverage before it is a claim about the code.** Report it as `covered N of M, no candidates`, never as a bare `no candidates`. The two differ by exactly the thing that went wrong the last time this protocol shipped a gap.
- **Dismissing needs a one-line reason** tied to the pattern's false-positive guard or the run context (bounded input, cold path, test fixture).
- **Disputed rows go to the round's performance lens**, implementer says false-positive but the evidence is unclear → that lens decides; its verdict is final for the sprint.
- **Critical candidates need a co-sign.** A candidate whose catalog default is Critical cannot be dismissed by the implementer alone. The round's performance lens co-signs the false-positive, and the dismissal carries over to whichever agent carries that lens: the merged reviewer's performance pass, in full mode and in 5-lite alike, or Reviewer D when the user has asked for the panel. Both modes route the same way now, so there is no route where the co-signer is missing and the rule has nobody to name.
- **Fix-in-wave is allowed** only for trivial fixes inside the wave's file allowlist, and only at the AGENT's run point, where the agent still holds those files; mark them `fixed` with the diff in the wave report. **The parent never fixes at round-end**, it stages, or sends the work back out as a one-task wave scoped to the owning file's allowlist, because every code change is written by a dispatched agent under an allowlist. Everything else waits for the address-all loop.

## Wrong → right micro-examples (top offenders)

Helpers like `mapWithLimit` / `createLruCache` stand for your project's own pool/LRU utility, search for an existing one before writing it (DRY).

**perf.data.n-plus-one**

```ts
// wrong, one query per id
for (const id of ids) orders.push(await repo.findOne(id))
// right, one batched query
const orders = await repo.findMany({ where: { id: { in: ids } } })
```

**perf.async.await-in-loop**

```ts
// wrong, independent items, serial latency
for (const u of urls) results.push(await fetchJson(u))
// right, bounded parallelism
const results = await mapWithLimit(urls, 5, fetchJson)
```

**perf.memory.json-deep-clone**

```ts
// wrong, full serialize + parse, loses Dates/Maps
const copy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(state))
// right
const copy = structuredClone(state)
```

**perf.process.spawn-per-item**

```bash
# wrong, two forks per file, and the list grows with the tree
while IFS= read -r f; do
  loc=$(wc -l < "$f" | tr -d ' ')
  check "$f" "$loc"
done < <(find . -name '*.md')
# right, one invocation over the whole batch
find . -name '*.md' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l | while read -r loc f; do check "$f" "$loc"; done
```

**perf.process.fork-for-builtin**

```bash
# wrong, two forks per item for an answer the shell already holds
while IFS= read -r f; do
  check "$(basename "$f")" "$(dirname "$f")"
done < <(find . -name '*.md')
# right, zero forks; the expansion replaces the fork on the line, no restructure
while IFS= read -r f; do
  check "${f##*/}" "${f%/*}"
done < <(find . -name '*.md')
```

**perf.algorithmic.string-concat-loop**

```ts
// wrong, quadratic reallocation
let csv = ''
for (const row of rows) csv += toLine(row)
// right, build once
const csv = rows.map(toLine).join('')
```

**perf.data.select-star**

```sql
-- wrong, wide rows, no covering index
SELECT * FROM users WHERE org_id = $1
-- right, name the columns you read
SELECT id, email, display_name FROM users WHERE org_id = $1
```

**perf.async.unbounded-fanout**

```ts
// wrong, one socket per user, all at once
await Promise.all(userIds.map(syncUser))
// right, pool of 10
await mapWithLimit(userIds, 10, syncUser)
```

**perf.io.sync-fs**

```ts
// wrong, blocks every in-flight request
const tpl = readFileSync(tplPath, 'utf8')
// right, async, read once at startup and reuse
const tpl = await readFile(tplPath, 'utf8')
```

**perf.data.unbounded-result**

```ts
// wrong, grows with the table
const rows = await db.query('SELECT id, name FROM events ORDER BY id')
// right, keyset page
const rows = await db.query(
  'SELECT id, name FROM events WHERE id > $1 ORDER BY id LIMIT 100', [cursor]
)
```

**perf.frontend.unstable-props**

```tsx
// wrong, new object + lambda every render
<Row style={{ padding: 8 }} onSelect={() => pick(row.id)} />
// right, stable references
<Row style={rowStyle} onSelect={handlePick} />
```

**perf.memory.unbounded-cache**

```ts
// wrong, grows forever
const cache = new Map<string, User>()
cache.set(key, user)
// right, bounded LRU with TTL
const cache = createLruCache<User>({ maxSize: 5000, ttlMs: 60_000 })
```
