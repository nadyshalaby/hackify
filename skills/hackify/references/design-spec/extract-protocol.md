# Extract Protocol

How to produce a `DESIGN.md` when the design already exists somewhere: in a codebase, on a reference site, or in a set of screenshots. Also covers refreshing a spec after the product moved.

Output always conforms to [spec-contract.md](spec-contract.md). Direction naming comes from [direction-library.md](direction-library.md).

## Choosing a mode

| Situation | Mode |
|---|---|
| The project already has styles, tokens, or a component library | **A, from code** |
| The user points at a site or app they want to evoke | **B, from reference** |
| The user supplies screenshots, mockups, or a mood board | **C, from image** |
| A `DESIGN.md` exists and the product has drifted from it | **REFRESH** |
| Nothing exists yet | Not an extraction. Author from the direction library. |

Modes combine. The common real case is A plus B: the project has tokens, and the user wants them pushed toward a reference. Run A first to establish what is true, then B to establish what is wanted, then reconcile with the merge rules below.

## What you may not do

Binding, all modes:

- **Do not reproduce a brand identity.** Extracting layout logic, spacing rhythm, and type scale from a public site is legitimate analysis. Copying a company's name, wordmark, proprietary typeface, or exact palette into a spec presented as the product's own identity is not. Name the influence in the Overview; do not impersonate the source.
- **Do not ship a proprietary font as if it were available.** When the reference uses a licensed face, record it as `name` and supply a freely-licensed `substitute` with tuning notes (`spec-contract.md`, fonts).
- **Do not invent values you did not observe.** An extracted token must trace to something you actually read. Gaps are filled by *derivation* from the direction, and the Overview says which values were derived rather than observed.
- **Do not fetch anything at render time.** Extraction happens once, during authoring. The resulting spec and preview carry zero network references.

## Mode A (extract from code)

**Goal.** Recover the system the codebase is already expressing, including the parts it expresses inconsistently.

1. **Find the token source.** Search in this order and stop at the first that exists: a utility-framework config, a stylesheet entry point with custom properties, a `theme` or `tokens` module, a native theme file (`Theme.of`, `ColorScheme`, asset catalog), then component-level styles. Record which file you took each block from.
2. **Harvest colors.** Collect every color literal in the styling layer with its usage count and the properties it appears on. Sort by frequency.
3. **Cluster into roles.** The most-used background becomes `canvas`; the next distinct background on top of it becomes `surface`. The most-used text color becomes `text-primary`; lighter variants become `text-secondary` and `text-muted`. The most-used color on primary buttons becomes `accent`. Border colors become `hairline` and `hairline-strong`.
4. **Name the strays.** Any literal used fewer than three times is a stray. Do not promote strays to tokens. List them in the extraction report as drift to be fixed; they are the reason the spec is being written.
5. **Harvest type.** Collect font-size, weight, line-height and letter-spacing combinations with usage counts. Map the twelve required roles onto the most-used combinations. Where a required role has no match, derive it from the neighbouring steps in the scale.
6. **Recover the scales.** Sort observed spacing and radius values. Identify the base unit as the greatest common divisor of the frequent values. Snap near-misses to the scale and record every snap.
7. **Harvest components.** For each required component, read its real implementation and record its actual token composition and its real interactive states. States that do not exist in the code are noted as gaps, not invented.
8. **Name the direction.** Match the recovered system against the direction library. If two directions fit equally, the product is mixing directions, say so plainly in the report, because that is a finding.
9. **Write the report.** Before writing the spec, emit the extraction report (shape below) so the user sees the drift.

**Snapping rule.** When observed values cluster near a clean scale (13px, 14px, 15px, 16px against a 4px base), snap to the scale and list each snapped value with its original. Never silently round. A snap that changes a value by more than 15% is a change, not a snap, and needs the user's agreement.

## Mode B (extract from reference)

**Goal.** Turn a site or app the user admires into a spec for a different product.

1. **Confirm the intent.** Ask which part they want: the whole system, or one aspect (the type, the density, the motion). "Make it look like X" usually means one specific quality. Extracting everything when they wanted the spacing is wasted work.
2. **Collect evidence.** Read the reference's public styling. Record computed values for backgrounds, text, borders, radii, shadows, and type at several viewport widths. Note what changes between breakpoints.
3. **Separate structure from identity.** Structure is transferable: spacing rhythm, type scale ratio, density, elevation model, motion timing, grid logic. Identity is not: exact palette, proprietary typeface, wordmark, illustration style. Take the structure. Rebuild the identity for the user's product.
4. **Re-derive the palette.** Keep the reference's *palette logic* (how many roles, how saturated, how the accent is budgeted) and generate new values that fit the user's product. Record the logic in the Colors prose so the reasoning survives.
5. **Substitute the type.** Map the reference's faces to freely-licensed equivalents with matching proportions: x-height, contrast, width, and terminal treatment matter more than the name. Document the tuning that closes the gap.
6. **Name the direction and the debt.** Set `direction:` from the library and state in the Overview which qualities came from the reference and which were built fresh.

## Mode C (extract from image)

**Goal.** Turn screenshots, mockups, or a mood board into a spec.

1. **Establish the scale anchor.** Ask for one known measurement, usually the viewport width or the base body size. Everything else is measured relative to it. Without an anchor, every value is a guess and the spec will not match the design.
2. **Sample colors from flat regions.** Take samples from the middle of large flat areas, never from an edge, an antialiased boundary, or a compressed gradient. Record the sample location for each token so the value can be re-checked.
3. **Measure type by cap-height ratio.** Rendered screenshots do not carry font metrics. Measure cap-height in pixels, divide by the typical 0.7 cap-height ratio to estimate font size, then snap to the nearest step in a sensible scale.
4. **Infer, then mark as inferred.** Interactive states, motion, and responsive behavior are almost never visible in a static image. Derive them from the direction and mark every inferred value in the extraction report. Do not present inference as observation.
5. **Ask about the missing half.** Before writing, ask the user for: hover and focus behavior, dark or light counterpart, the smallest screen it must work on, and whether the imagery is representative or placeholder.

**Confidence rule.** Every value from Mode C is lower-confidence than Mode A or B. The extraction report states a confidence per block (observed / measured / inferred), and the spec's Overview notes that it was derived from static imagery.

## REFRESH mode

Run when a `DESIGN.md` already exists. Never author a second spec beside it.

1. Read the existing spec and record its `version`, `direction`, and token set.
2. Run Mode A against the current code.
3. Diff the recovered system against the spec. Classify every difference:

| Class | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Drift** | code moved away from the spec with no decision behind it | fix the code, spec unchanged |
| **Evolution** | code moved deliberately and the spec is stale | update the spec, bump `version` |
| **Gap** | code covers a surface the spec never described | add to the spec |
| **Dead** | spec describes something the code no longer has | remove from the spec |

4. Present the classification to the user before editing either side. Drift and evolution look identical in a diff; only the user knows which it was.
5. Apply, bump `version`, and regenerate the preview.

---

## Merge rules

When two sources disagree:

1. **The user's stated intent wins over any observed value.** They are asking for a change.
2. **An existing committed spec wins over extracted code.** Code drifts; the spec is the decision. Unless the user classifies the difference as evolution.
3. **Observed beats inferred.** A measured value replaces a derived one.
4. **Frequency breaks ties within a source.** The value used 40 times is the system; the value used twice is the stray.
5. **When still tied, ask.** Two equally-supported answers is a real fork, and a wrong guess propagates into every screen.

## Extraction report

Emit before writing the spec. Keep it under 300 words.

```
## Extraction report (<mode(s)>)

**Source.** <files read / reference / images, with counts>
**Direction matched.** <slug>, <one-line why>

### Recovered
| Block | Tokens | Confidence | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| colors | 16 | observed | theme file + 3 component files |
| typography | 12 roles | 9 observed, 3 derived | stylesheet entry point |
| spacing | 8 steps, 4px base | observed, 6 values snapped | utility config |

### Drift found
- `<value>` used <n> times outside the token set at `<file:line>`, <proposed role or removal>

### Gaps filled by derivation
- `<token>`, derived from <direction> because <reason>

### Needs your decision
- <question>
```

The **Drift found** section is the point of the exercise. A clean extraction with no drift usually means the search was too narrow, not that the codebase is perfect.
