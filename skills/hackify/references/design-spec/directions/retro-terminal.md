## Retro Terminal (`retro-terminal`)

> The machine talks back in its own voice, and expects you to keep up.

**Feels like.** A console session in a dark room. Everything is text, everything is fast, and the interface assumes competence rather than explaining itself.

**Palette logic.** A near-black field with a slight color cast (blue-black or warm brown-black, never pure `#000`), one phosphor color as the near-universal foreground (amber, P1 green, or bone white), and a second phosphor used only for errors. Color is a signal, never a surface.

**Surface & depth.** Flat. Depth is implied by dimming: inactive regions drop to 40% foreground opacity. Optional very low-amplitude scanline or noise texture, never strong enough to hurt reading.

**Type pairing.** Everything monospaced. Display and body both `IBM Plex Mono`, size and weight carrying the entire hierarchy. Optionally `VT323` for a single large display moment.

**Motion.** Typewriter reveals on first paint only, a blinking block cursor, and instant state changes everywhere else. 75ms or nothing.

**Signature move.** A live status line pinned to one edge, always showing state (connection, mode, counts) in `KEY: value` pairs. The interface is never silent about what it is doing.

**Anti-tells.** CRT curvature and heavy glow (kitsch, not craft). Neon rainbow palettes. Proportional body text sneaking in. Rounded corners of any radius. Emoji.

**Best for.** Developer CLIs and their companion web UIs, self-hosted tooling, security and network products, hacker-audience side projects.
