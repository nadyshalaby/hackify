## Soft Depth (`soft-depth`)

> Layered, light, and modern, achieved with restraint rather than effects.

**Feels like.** Panes of frosted glass stacked in daylight. Clear hierarchy through layering, with a friendly rather than technical tone.

**Palette logic.** A very light neutral field with a barely-perceptible cool or warm tint, surfaces slightly lighter than the canvas, and one confident accent used for primary action and active state. Tints of the accent at 8-12% opacity carry selected and hover states.

**Surface & depth.** The whole point: three clear layers (canvas, surface, raised) distinguished by value, a soft large-radius shadow, and a 1px light border on top edges to suggest a lit surface. Translucency only where something meaningful sits behind it.

**Type pairing.** `General Sans` across display and body at contrasting weights; mono `Spline Sans Mono`. Comfortable sizes, moderate line-height, nothing extreme.

**Motion.** Smooth and unhurried. 240ms transitions on a decelerating curve, layered elements entering with a 4px rise and a fade, and staggered list reveals at 40ms intervals.

**Signature move.** The lit top edge: every raised surface carries a 1px highlight border on its upper edge and a soft wide shadow below, so layers read as physically stacked without any blur effect doing the work.

**Anti-tells.** Heavy backdrop blur everywhere (a generic-AI signal and a performance problem). Purple gradients. Shadow so strong the layers detach. Four or more layers, at which point the hierarchy stops being readable. Glassmorphism applied to elements with nothing behind them.

**Best for.** Consumer SaaS, onboarding and settings surfaces, cross-platform apps that must feel native on both, general-purpose product UI.
