description: >
  Charged, technical, and lit from within. A deep indigo-black field with electric
  cyan used strictly as a light source: thin glowing borders, small filled
  indicators, and text highlights, never as a large fill and never inside a
  gradient. Containers carry angled corner cuts rather than radii. Focus is
  expressed as illumination, and motion suggests a system that is actively running.

## Overview

This system is lit from inside. `{colors.canvas}` is an indigo-black with a real blue cast, and the interface elements sitting on it do not reflect light so much as emit it. Cyan `{colors.accent}` is treated strictly as a **light source**: a 1px border with a soft glow behind it, a small filled indicator, a text highlight. It is never a large flat fill and never one stop in a gradient.

That restriction is what separates this direction from the purple-to-pink gradient wash that has become the default AI aesthetic. This direction sits closer to that cliché than any other in the catalog, and the discipline that keeps it clear is simple: **color is emitted by small things**. A screen with a large cyan panel has already failed.

Geometry is angular. Containers carry a clipped corner (a 45-degree cut of 10 to 14px on one or two corners) rather than a radius, which reads as machined rather than softened. Radii in the token set stay at 1 to 6px for controls only, and cards and modals use `{rounded.none}` with the clip applied via `clip-path`.

**Signature moves:**
- The lit edge: a 1px cyan border with a soft matching glow marking whatever is currently active.
- Angled corner cuts on containers instead of radii.
- Cyan as a light source only: borders, small fills, indicators, never large areas.
- A fine grid overlay at 2 to 3% opacity across the canvas.
- Pulsing live indicators and a sweeping highlight on load, so the system reads as running.
- Wide-tracked mono overlines at 0.18em labelling every panel.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Cyan** (`{colors.accent}` — `#3ce0e0`): the primary light source. Active borders, focus, the single filled primary button, live indicators, sort markers. Contrast against `{colors.on-accent}` is 12.24:1.
- **Cyan Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}` — `#6ceded`, `{colors.accent-press}` — `#2bb3b3`).
- **Magenta** (`{colors.accent-two}` — `#e0409c`): the permitted second light source, used for a genuinely different meaning: a second data series, an opposing team, a secondary channel. It is never decorative and never mixed with cyan in the same element. If a product has no second meaning to encode, this token stays unused.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#08090f`): the indigo-black field.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}` — `#0e1019`): panels and cards.
- **Surface Raised** (`{colors.surface-raised}` — `#141726`): hover fills, toasts.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}` — `#05060a`): inputs, terminals, log wells.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#1c2033`) and **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#2a3050`): unlit borders, the default state of every container.

### Text
- **Ice** (`{colors.text-primary}` — `#dfe3f2`): headings and values. Contrast on canvas 15.53:1.
- **Ice Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}` — `#8b90ad`): labels, chrome, inactive items. Contrast 6.33:1.
- **Ice Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — `#5d6382`): disabled, timestamps.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#3fd68a`), **Caution** (`{colors.caution}` — `#f5c344`), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#ff4d6a`). Each is treated as its own light source, following the same rule as the accent: small fills, glowing borders, and text, never large panels.

## Typography

### Font Family

`Chakra Petch` is a semi-condensed display face with clipped, angular terminals that echo the corner cuts in the layout. Its geometry is the typographic half of the system's machined feel, and it is used for headings and button labels rather than body copy, where its angularity would tire the reader.

`Sora` carries body copy. It is a geometric sans with slightly squared bowls, technical without being harsh, and it holds up at 13 to 14px on a dark background where softer faces bloom.

`Fira Code` handles figures and overlines. Its wide-tracked uppercase forms at 0.18em are the system's chrome voice.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 58px | 700 | 1.05 | -1px | Page or landing headline |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 40px | 700 | 1.1 | -0.6px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 27px | 600 | 1.2 | -0.2px | Panel title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 20px | 600 | 1.3 | 0 | Card title |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 15px | 600 | 1.35 | 0.04em | Uppercase group label |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 16px | 400 | 1.65 | 0 | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 14px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 13px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Dense panels |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 | Helper text |
| `{typography.overline}` | 11px | 500 | 1.2 | 0.18em | Mono uppercase panel labels |
| `{typography.button}` | 14px | 600 | 1 | 0.08em | Uppercase button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 13px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Uppercase plus wide tracking marks every label.** Overlines at 0.18em and buttons at 0.08em. This is the system's most consistent typographic gesture.
- **Chakra Petch stays out of body copy.** Its angularity is a display quality; at 14px across a paragraph it becomes noise.
- **Body text is never dimmed below `{colors.text-secondary}`.** Low-contrast text on a dark field is the most common accessibility failure in this aesthetic.
- **No text glow.** Glowing body text is illegible and is the fastest way to make this direction look cheap. Glow belongs to borders and indicators.

## Layout

**Base unit: 4px**, scale 4 / 8 / 12 / 20 / 28 / 44 / 72.

**Container** maxes at 1360px, wide because this direction usually serves dashboard-shaped products.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a 20px gutter, and panels commonly span asymmetric ranges. A **fine grid overlay** may sit across the canvas: 1px lines at 2 to 3% white opacity on a 40px or 48px pitch, aligned to the layout grid. It should be barely visible and must never sit above content.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Moderately tight. `{spacing.huge}` 72px between major regions, `{spacing.lg}` 20px inside panels. This is a control-surface aesthetic, so screens are fuller than in a marketing-led direction, though not as dense as `data-dense`.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is **glow**. Elevation is expressed by how lit an element is, not by how far it floats.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` border | Every panel and card at rest |
| 1 | `{elevation.1}` — a crisp 1px ring | Hovered panels, toasts |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` — 12px cyan glow plus a cyan ring | The active or focused element |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` — deep shadow plus a ring | Modals |

**Only one element on a screen carries `{elevation.2}` at a time.** Glow marks focus, and focus is singular by definition. Applying glow to every card flattens the hierarchy that glow exists to create, which is the most common way this direction is built wrong.

Glow is always **outside** the element (an outer box-shadow with no offset), never an inner shadow and never applied to text.

## Shapes

Radii stay minimal and the identity comes from **clipped corners** instead.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0 | Cards, modals, panels, tables |
| `{rounded.xs}` – `{rounded.md}` | 1–3px | Buttons, inputs, badges |
| `{rounded.lg}` – `{rounded.xl}` | 4–6px | Dropdowns |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Status dots and progress tracks only |

**The corner cut** is applied with `clip-path` on cards, modals, and hero containers: a 45-degree bevel of 10 to 14px, on the top-inline-start and bottom-inline-end corners only. Cutting all four corners reads as a badge rather than a panel. When a clipped element needs a border, draw it with a matching clipped pseudo-element rather than `border`, since `clip-path` cuts the border too.

**Imagery** is high-contrast, often duotone in cyan and magenta, with hard clipped corners. Icons are 1.5px stroke on a 20px grid with squared terminals, matching the display face.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 60ms | Hover fills |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 150ms | Border and glow state changes |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 240ms | Panel and dropdown entry |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 360ms | Modal entry |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 800ms | Load sweep, once per view |

**Three signature animations:**

1. **The glow transition.** When an element becomes active, its border shifts to cyan and the outer glow fades in over 150ms. This is the system's core feedback and should be the only thing most interactions do.
2. **The pulse.** Live indicators (a connection dot, a recording marker) pulse their glow between 40% and 100% opacity on a 2s cycle. Reserved for genuinely live state; a decorative pulse is noise.
3. **The load sweep.** On first paint, a narrow cyan highlight sweeps once across the top edge of the primary panel over 800ms, then stops. Once per view.

**Reduced motion:** disable the pulse, the sweep, and any scan effect. Keep the static glow, since it carries state rather than motion.

## Components

### Buttons
`button-primary` is a cyan fill with near-black uppercase text at 0.08em tracking, gaining a glow on hover. There is one per view. `button-secondary` is the more common treatment: transparent with a 1px cyan border and cyan text, gaining a glow on hover. `button-ghost` is dim text with no border.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a sunken well with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` border that becomes a lit cyan edge with glow on focus. That focus treatment is the clearest in the catalog and is the direction's best feature. Labels sit above in `{typography.overline}` at full 0.18em tracking. Errors appear below in `{colors.negative}` with a matching lit border on the field.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is `{colors.surface}` with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` border, square, with a clipped top-inline-start corner and `{spacing.lg}` padding. Panel titles are `{typography.overline}`, often with a thin cyan rule beneath. `nav-bar` sits on `{colors.surface}` with a bottom hairline; the active item is cyan with a 2px lit bottom border.

### Data
`table-row` uses `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum` and `{colors.hairline}` bottom rules. Hover lifts the row to `{colors.surface-raised}`. The selected row takes a 2px lit cyan inline-start border with a subtle glow, which is the one place glow appears in a list. Headers are `{typography.overline}` and stick on scroll.

### Feedback
`badge` is a cyan hairline outline with cyan uppercase text and no fill; semantic variants swap to their own color on the same pattern. `toast` sits on `{colors.surface-raised}` with a hairline border and a lit inline-start edge in the relevant semantic color. `modal` is square with a clipped corner, a 1px cyan border, `{elevation.3}`, over a `{colors.canvas}` overlay at 84% opacity, unblurred.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Full multi-panel layout; grid overlay visible; corner cuts at 14px |
| `lg` | 1024–1439px | Panels reduce to two columns; cuts at 12px |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Single panel column; grid overlay removed |
| `sm` | < 768px | Stacked; display-xl to 32px; cuts at 8px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 58 → 32px, display-lg 40 → 26px, heading-lg 27 → 21px. Body stays at 14px. Overline tracking reduces from 0.18em to 0.12em so labels do not wrap.

**The grid overlay is removed below `md`,** where it costs rendering time and adds visual noise on a small screen.

**Glow is reduced, not removed,** on small screens: the 12px blur drops to 8px so it does not bleed across a narrow layout.

**Accessibility note.** This aesthetic invites low-contrast choices. Every text color here clears AA against its background by a wide margin, and glow is never used as the only indicator of state: an active element also changes border color and, where relevant, carries a text or icon change. Test with `prefers-contrast: more`, where the grid overlay and all glow should be dropped in favor of solid 2px borders.

**RTL** uses logical properties. The corner cut mirrors to the opposite corners, and the load sweep runs from the inline start, so both follow the reading direction.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Treat cyan as a light source: 1px borders, small fills, indicators.
- Use clipped 45-degree corners on containers instead of radii.
- Limit `{elevation.2}` glow to exactly one element per screen.
- Track uppercase labels wide, at 0.18em on overlines.
- Reserve the pulse for genuinely live state.
- Keep body text at or above `{colors.text-secondary}` for contrast.
- Drop the grid overlay and glow under `prefers-contrast: more`.

### Don't
- Don't use a purple-to-pink gradient background. This is the cliché the direction must avoid.
- Don't apply glow to every element; it destroys the hierarchy it creates.
- Don't put glow on text. It is illegible and looks cheap.
- Don't fill large areas with cyan or magenta.
- Don't cut all four corners; two is the pattern.
- Don't add decorative glitch effects.
- Don't dim body text for atmosphere.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#08090f` · Surface `#0e1019` · Ice `#dfe3f2` / `#8b90ad` · Cyan `#3ce0e0` · Magenta `#e0409c` (second meaning only) · Border 1px `#2a3050` · Corner cut 12px on two corners · Fira Code overlines at 0.18em · Chakra Petch headings, Sora body.

**Building a screen:**

> Build this in the Cyber Neon system. Indigo-black canvas `#08090f`, panels on `#0e1019` with 1px `#2a3050` borders and a 12px 45-degree `clip-path` bevel on the top-left and bottom-right corners only. Headings in Chakra Petch 700, body in Sora 14px. Panel labels in Fira Code 11px uppercase at 0.18em tracking. Cyan `#3ce0e0` only as a light source: 1px borders, small indicators, one filled button. The focused element, and only that element, gets `box-shadow: 0 0 12px rgba(60,224,224,0.18), 0 0 0 1px #3ce0e0`. Optional 1px grid overlay at 2% white opacity on a 48px pitch. No gradients, no glowing text, no purple.

**Building a form:**

> Fields on `#05060a` with a 1px `#2a3050` border, 2px radius. On focus, the border becomes `#3ce0e0` with a 12px cyan outer glow. Labels above in Fira Code 11px uppercase at 0.18em. Errors below in `#ff4d6a` with the field border lit in the same color. Submit as the single cyan filled button, uppercase Chakra Petch at 0.08em tracking.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Cyan is a light source on small things, never a large fill or a gradient.
2. One glowing element per screen; glow means focus.
3. Clipped corners, not radii, and never glowing text.
