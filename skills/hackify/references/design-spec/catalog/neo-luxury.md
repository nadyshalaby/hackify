  Restraint as the message. A near-black field, warm off-white text, and a
  champagne accent used only at small scale. Display type is a light-weight serif
  set large, introduced by a small all-caps overline floating far above it. Motion
  is slow and infrequent, depth comes from light rather than shadow, and space is
  spent generously enough to feel like a decision rather than a default.

## Overview

Everything in this system is an argument for scarcity. `{colors.canvas}` is a near-black with a faint violet cast, never pure black, because pure black is a default and this system is built out of decisions. Text is `{colors.text-primary}`, a warm off-white that reads as paper rather than screen. Between them sit exactly two greys and one accent.

That accent, `{colors.accent}` champagne, is used at **small scale only**: a hairline border on a badge, an underline beneath a link, a single filled button in a full page. Large champagne fills, gradients, or metallic textures immediately move this direction into the territory it is defined against. The rule is simple: if you can see the accent from across the room, there is too much of it.

The typographic signature is the gap. A small all-caps overline at 0.22em tracking floats well above a large light-weight `Cormorant Garamond` headline, with more vertical space between the two than feels comfortable. That discomfort is the effect: space this expensive signals that nothing here needs to compete for room.

**Signature moves:**
- The wide-tracked overline (0.22em) suspended far above a light serif headline.
- Display serif at weight 300 and never heavier; weight reads as cheap here.
- Champagne used only at small scale, never as a large fill or a gradient.
- Depth by light: a 1px top highlight at 6% opacity, rather than a shadow.
- Very slow motion, 520ms base and 1100ms for the page reveal.
- Section rhythm at 176px, the most generous in the catalog.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Champagne** (`{colors.accent}` — `#c9a961`): the single primary button on a page, hairline borders on badges, link underlines, and active indicators. Contrast against `{colors.on-accent}` is 8.43:1. Small scale only.
- **Champagne Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}` — `#d8bb79`, `{colors.accent-press}` — `#a88b4a`).

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#111013`): the field. Warm near-black with a faint violet cast.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}` — `#17161a`): cards and modals, one step up.
- **Surface Raised** (`{colors.surface-raised}` — `#1e1c21`): toasts and popovers.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}` — `#0c0b0e`): image wells and quiet insets.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#26242a`) and **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#363239`): borders at very low contrast, meant to be sensed rather than seen.

### Text
- **Alabaster** (`{colors.text-primary}` — `#ece7dd`): headings and body. Contrast on canvas 15.39:1.
- **Alabaster Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}` — `#9b9489`): supporting copy, navigation, captions. Contrast 6.31:1.
- **Alabaster Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — `#6d6760`): disabled states, fine print.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#7d9b6a`), **Caution** (identical to the accent by design, since in a restrained system a caution and a highlight are the same event), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#cf8471`). All are muted and warm so nothing in the palette raises its voice.

## Typography

### Font Family

`Cormorant Garamond` at weight 300 is the whole identity. It is a display serif with extremely fine hairlines and generous, calligraphic forms, and it only works large: below 26px the thin strokes break up and it reads as a rendering error. That constraint enforces the direction's discipline, since it makes a small headline impossible.

`Jost` carries body copy at weight 300. It is a geometric sans in the Futura lineage, with circular bowls and a high-waisted construction that stays quiet beside the serif. Its light weight matched with slight positive tracking (0.01em) is what keeps body text from feeling dense.

`Courier Prime` handles figures. A typewriter monospace is an unusual choice for numerics, and it is deliberate: it reads as a ledger entry rather than a dashboard metric, which suits products where numbers are prices rather than measurements.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 76px | 300 | 1.1 | -0.5px | Page headline, one per view |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 52px | 300 | 1.15 | -0.3px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 36px | 300 | 1.2 | 0 | Feature title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 26px | 400 | 1.3 | 0 | Card title, the serif floor |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 16px | 400 | 1.4 | 0.06em | Uppercase group label (body face) |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 17px | 300 | 1.75 | 0.01em | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 15px | 300 | 1.7 | 0.01em | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 13px | 300 | 1.6 | 0.02em | Captions, table cells |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 300 | 1.5 | 0.02em | Fine print |
| `{typography.overline}` | 11px | 400 | 1.2 | 0.22em | The signature overline |
| `{typography.button}` | 13px | 400 | 1 | 0.16em | Uppercase button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 14px | 400 | 1.6 | 0.02em | Prices and figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Weight 300 on every display role.** At 400 the serif thickens and the whole system reads mid-market. This is the single most important typographic rule here.
- **Never set Cormorant below 26px.** Use `Jost` for anything smaller.
- **The overline gap is 40px or more.** The space between the overline and the headline it introduces is what makes the pairing work.
- **Positive tracking on light body text.** 0.01em to 0.02em keeps 300-weight text from collapsing at small sizes.
- **Sentence case headlines, uppercase labels.** Never uppercase a serif headline; the letterforms are designed for mixed case.

## Layout

**Base unit: 8px**, with a scale that grows fast: 8 / 16 / 24 / 40 / 64 / 96 / 176. The top step is deliberately extreme.

**Container** maxes at 1320px with wide outer margins, and content rarely fills it. A headline occupying six of twelve columns with the rest empty is a standard composition here, not an unfinished one.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a 40px gutter. Content is typically inset from both edges by two columns, so the effective content area is eight columns wide inside a twelve-column frame. That inset is where the sense of space comes from.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Space is the product. `{spacing.huge}` at 176px between major sections, `{spacing.xxl}` at 96px between subsections. If a page feels empty, it is probably correct. The temptation to fill space with a secondary call to action or a testimonial strip is the main way this direction is diluted.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is **light**, not shadow.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Most surfaces |
| 1 | `{elevation.1}` — a 1px top highlight at 6% opacity | Cards, raised panels |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` | Toasts, popovers |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` | Modals |

`{elevation.1}` is not a shadow at all: it is a single-pixel light line along the top edge, as if the surface catches a low light source. Combined with a surface value one step above the canvas, that is enough to read as raised. Shadows at levels 2 and 3 are very large and very soft (48px and 96px blur) so they read as ambient darkness rather than as a drop shadow.

**Optional atmosphere:** a very subtle vertical value gradient across large surfaces, no more than a 3% shift from top to bottom, suggesting light falling through the page. It must never be perceptible as a gradient.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0 | Inputs, images, rules |
| `{rounded.xs}` – `{rounded.md}` | 1–2px | Buttons, badges, small controls |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 3px | Cards |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 4px | Modals, the maximum |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Avatars only |

Radius is nearly absent. Above 4px this system starts to read as friendly, which is not the register.

**Imagery** is the one place where scale is permitted to be dramatic. Photographs run full-bleed or inset at `{rounded.none}`, in 3:2 or 2:3, with no border and no shadow. Product images sit on `{colors.surface-sunken}` with generous padding, so the object floats in a dark field. Avoid photographic clichés: marble, gold bars, skylines, and watches on wrists all signal the opposite of what the restraint is doing. Icons are 1px stroke on a 24px grid, used sparingly.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 200ms | Color changes, the fastest thing here |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 320ms | Button and link states |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 520ms | Content transitions, menu open |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 700ms | Modal entry, image cross-fade |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 1100ms | Page-load reveal |

Every duration in this system is roughly double its equivalent elsewhere. Nothing moves quickly, because speed reads as urgency and urgency reads as a sale.

**The page-load reveal** is the one orchestrated moment: overline, headline, body, and action fade in sequentially with a 6px rise, staggered at 120ms, over a 1100ms total. It runs once per page and nothing else on the page animates on entry.

**Reduced motion:** honor `prefers-reduced-motion`. Remove all translation, keep opacity, and halve every duration so the page does not feel unresponsive when movement is stripped out.

## Components

### Buttons
`button-primary` is a champagne fill with near-black uppercase text at 0.16em tracking, at `{rounded.sm}`. There is **one per page**. `button-secondary` is a hairline outline that shifts border and text to champagne on hover. `button-ghost` is a champagne underline, which is the correct treatment for most secondary actions here.

### Inputs & Forms
Inputs are **underlines only**: transparent background with a single bottom hairline that turns champagne on focus. No fill, no box, no radius. Labels sit above in `{typography.overline}` with its full 0.22em tracking. The form reads as a series of ruled lines on a dark page, which suits the register far better than a stack of filled fields.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is `{colors.surface}` at `{rounded.lg}` with a hairline border and the 1px top highlight. `nav-bar` is transparent with no border and no background change on scroll; items are `{typography.overline}` in `{colors.text-secondary}`, with the active item in `{colors.text-primary}` and a 1px champagne underline.

### Data
`table-row` uses `{typography.body-sm}` with hairline bottom rules and generous padding. Prices and figures use `{typography.numeric}` in Courier Prime with `tnum`. No zebra striping, no vertical rules. Hover lifts the row to `{colors.surface}`.

### Feedback
`badge` is a champagne hairline outline with champagne uppercase text and no fill. `toast` sits on `{colors.surface-raised}` at `{elevation.2}`, bottom-inline-end, dismissing after 8 seconds, which is slower than usual and consistent with everything else. `modal` is `{rounded.xl}` at `{elevation.3}` over a `{colors.canvas}` overlay at 88% opacity, unblurred.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Full two-column inset; 176px section rhythm |
| `lg` | 1024–1439px | Inset narrows to one column each side |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Inset drops; display-xl to 52px |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; display-xl to 36px; rhythm to 88px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 76 → 36px, display-lg 52 → 30px, heading-lg 36 → 26px. Cormorant is never allowed below 26px, so at `sm` the headline sits exactly at its floor.

**The overline gap** compresses from 40px to 24px but never disappears; it is the signature and it survives every breakpoint.

**Section rhythm** drops from 176px to 88px, which is still the most generous in the catalog at that width.

**Native specifics:** light-content status bar. Haptics fire on the primary action only, because frequent haptic feedback is a busy sensation and this system is not busy. Modals present as full-screen covers with a slow cross-fade rather than as bottom sheets, which read as more casual. Dynamic Type is honored, with Cormorant swapping to Jost at the largest accessibility sizes where its hairlines would fail.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Keep every display role at weight 300.
- Float the 0.22em overline at least 40px above the headline it introduces.
- Use champagne only at small scale: hairlines, underlines, one filled button.
- Express depth as a 1px top highlight, not a drop shadow.
- Spend space generously, 176px between sections at desktop.
- Set forms as underlined fields with no fill.
- Slow every transition to roughly double a conventional duration.

### Don't
- Don't use gold gradients, metallic texture fills, or shimmer effects.
- Don't set Cormorant Garamond below 26px or above weight 400.
- Don't add a second accent color.
- Don't fill empty space with a secondary call to action.
- Don't use fast transitions; speed reads as urgency, urgency reads as a sale.
- Don't use luxury stock photography clichés: marble, gold, skylines, watches.
- Don't put more than one filled button on a page.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#111013` · Surface `#17161a` · Alabaster `#ece7dd` / `#9b9489` · Champagne `#c9a961` · Radius 2–4px · Section rhythm 176px · Cormorant Garamond 300 display, Jost 300 body, Courier Prime figures.

**Building a page:**

> Build this in the Neo-Luxury system. Near-black canvas `#111013`, warm off-white text `#ece7dd`. Headline in Cormorant Garamond weight 300 at 76px. Above it, an overline in Jost 11px uppercase at 0.22em tracking, separated by at least 40px of empty space. Body in Jost weight 300 at 15px with 1.7 line-height and 0.01em tracking. One champagne `#c9a961` filled button on the entire page; everything else is a hairline outline or an underline. Cards use a 1px top highlight at 6% opacity instead of a shadow. Radius 3px maximum. Section gaps of 176px. All transitions 520ms or slower.

**Building a form:**

> Fields as underlines only: transparent background, 1px `#363239` bottom border turning `#c9a961` on focus, no radius, no fill. Labels above in Jost 11px uppercase at 0.22em tracking. Submit as the single champagne filled button, uppercase at 0.16em tracking.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Weight 300 on display type, always.
2. Champagne only at small scale, never as a large fill or gradient.
3. The overline gap is the signature; protect it at every breakpoint.
