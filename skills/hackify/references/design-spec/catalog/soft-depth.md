description: >
  Layered, light, and modern, achieved with restraint rather than effects. Three
  clear surface levels separated by value, a soft wide shadow below, and a 1px
  highlight along the top edge so layers read as physically stacked without any
  blur doing the work. One confident indigo accent carries action, with 8 to 12
  percent tints handling hover and selected states.

## Overview

This system is about layers, and it builds them without a single blur. `{colors.canvas}` is a very light neutral with a faint cool tint, `{colors.surface}` is pure white sitting a step above it, and the raised level is the same white lifted by shadow. Three levels, distinguished by value and by light, is the whole depth model.

The move that makes it work is the **lit top edge**: an inset 1px highlight at 90% white along the upper edge of every raised surface, paired with a soft wide shadow below. That combination is how real objects sit in real light, and it produces a convincing sense of stacking without any backdrop blur. Glassmorphism achieves a similar effect with a much higher rendering cost and a strong association with generic AI output, which is why this direction does it with two box-shadow values instead.

Indigo `{colors.accent}` carries action confidently. Unlike the restrained accents in `nordic-calm` or `neo-luxury`, it is meant to be seen: a filled primary button on every screen is correct here. Its 8 to 12 percent tints handle hover, selected, and active states, which keeps the interface coherent without introducing new colors.

**Signature moves:**
- The lit top edge: `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.9)` on every raised surface.
- Exactly three surface levels; a fourth makes the hierarchy unreadable.
- Soft wide shadows at 5 to 16% opacity, always paired with the inset highlight.
- Accent tints at 8 to 12 percent for hover and selected states, never new colors.
- Layered entry: a 4px rise with a fade, staggered at 40ms for lists.
- No backdrop blur anywhere, by policy.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Indigo** (`{colors.accent}` — `#3355e0`): primary buttons, active navigation, links, focus rings, selected states. Contrast against white is 5.97:1. Confident and frequent, unlike the restrained accents elsewhere in this catalog.
- **Indigo Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}` — `#4463e8`, `{colors.accent-press}` — `#2843c2`).
- **Indigo tints** at 8% and 12% opacity carry hover fills, selected rows, and active tabs. These are computed from the accent rather than being separate tokens, so a brand color change propagates correctly.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#f6f7fa`): the base layer, faintly cool.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}` — `#ffffff`): cards, inputs, nav, modals. The second layer.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}` — `#eef0f6`): hover fills, badges, wells, disabled states.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#e3e6ef`): card borders and row rules, working alongside the shadow rather than instead of it.
- **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#cdd2e0`): input and secondary-button borders.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.text-primary}` — `#15181f`): headings and body. Contrast on canvas 16.58:1.
- **Ink Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}` — `#5a6172`): supporting copy, labels, navigation. Contrast 5.79:1.
- **Ink Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — `#8b92a5`): placeholders, disabled, timestamps.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#157a4c`, 5.00:1), **Caution** (`{colors.caution}` — `#8a5f10`, 5.26:1), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#bf3225`, 5.30:1). Each follows the accent's pattern: a solid color for text and icons, an 8 to 12 percent tint for banner and badge backgrounds. Never a fully saturated background panel.

## Typography

### Font Family

One family, `General Sans`, at 400 and 600. It is a contemporary geometric-humanist sans with even proportions, a generous x-height, and a genuinely neutral tone, which is what a general-purpose product system needs: it should not editorialize about the content it holds.

Using a single family across display and body is deliberate. This direction serves cross-platform product work, and a single family is far easier to keep consistent across web, iOS, and Android than a display-plus-body pairing that may not render identically everywhere.

`Spline Sans Mono` handles figures. It shares the humanist proportions of General Sans, so tables mixing labels and numbers stay visually coherent.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 50px | 600 | 1.12 | -1.2px | Marketing or onboarding hero |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 36px | 600 | 1.18 | -0.8px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 26px | 600 | 1.25 | -0.4px | Page title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 20px | 600 | 1.35 | -0.2px | Card and panel title |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 16px | 600 | 1.4 | 0 | Form group, list header |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 17px | 400 | 1.65 | 0 | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 15px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 | Default body and UI text |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 13px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Metadata, table cells |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 | Helper text |
| `{typography.overline}` | 11px | 600 | 1.25 | 0.07em | Uppercase section label |
| `{typography.button}` | 15px | 600 | 1 | 0 | Button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 14px | 400 | 1.5 | -0.01em | Figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Two weights, 400 and 600.** A 500 weight blurs the distinction between body and emphasis.
- **Negative tracking scales with size,** from -1.2px at 50px to 0 at 16px.
- **Body at 15px with 1.6 line-height** is the workhorse and should cover most of the interface.
- **Overlines are used sparingly,** for genuine section labels rather than decorating every heading.
- **Figures switch to mono in tables and metrics,** but stay in the body face inside sentences, since a mono number mid-paragraph is a visual interruption.

## Layout

**Base unit: 2px** with a practical scale of 6 / 10 / 14 / 20 / 32 / 48 / 80. The slightly unusual values (10, 14) come from targeting comfortable control heights: a 10px vertical padding on a 15px label gives a 38px button.

**Container** maxes at 1200px with `{spacing.xl}` gutters.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a 20px gutter. Common layouts are a 3+9 app shell with a persistent sidebar, and 2-up or 3-up card grids inside the content area.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Comfortable and even. `{spacing.huge}` 80px between major sections, `{spacing.xxl}` 48px between blocks, `{spacing.xl}` 32px inside cards, `{spacing.lg}` 20px between related elements. This is the most conventional spacing model in the catalog, which suits a direction meant to serve general-purpose product work without imposing a strong opinion.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is **layered light**: a soft shadow below plus an inset highlight above.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Canvas-level content, nav at rest |
| 1 | `{elevation.1}` | Cards, buttons, inputs |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` | Hovered cards, dropdowns, toasts, sticky nav |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` | Modals and sheets |

Every level above 0 carries `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.9)`. On a white surface this highlight is nearly invisible in isolation and clearly felt in combination with the shadow, which is exactly the intent.

**Three layers maximum.** Canvas, surface, raised. A fourth layer (a card inside a card inside a panel) makes the hierarchy unreadable, and the correct fix is to flatten the nesting rather than to invent another value.

**No backdrop blur.** This is a policy, not a preference: blur is expensive on large surfaces, degrades text rendering behind it, and reads as a generic AI signal. Translucency is permitted only where meaningful content sits behind, such as a sticky header over scrolling content, and even there a 92% opaque solid is preferred.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 4px | Checkboxes, small chips |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 6px | Badges, tags, inline code |
| `{rounded.md}` | 8px | Buttons, inputs, selects |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 12px | Cards, panels, images |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 18px | Modals, sheets |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Avatars, toggles, progress tracks |

Radii are moderate and scale gently with element size. Nested elements use a radius at least 4px smaller than their parent so the inner corner does not visually collide with the outer one.

**Imagery** sits at `{rounded.lg}` with no border and no shadow, since it is content inside an already-elevated card. Illustration works well in flat style using the accent and its tints. Icons are 1.5px stroke on a 20px grid, with 2px stroke for the primary navigation.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 90ms | Color-only changes |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 150ms | Button and input states |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 240ms | Card hover lift, dropdown, tab change |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 340ms | Modal and sheet entry |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 520ms | Page-load reveal |

**Layered entry is the signature:** an element enters with a 4px rise and a fade over 240ms on a decelerating curve, so it appears to settle onto its layer. Lists stagger at 40ms per item, capped at eight items so a long list does not feel slow.

**Hover lifts one level.** A card at `{elevation.1}` moves to `{elevation.2}` on hover with a 1px translate upward. The change is small and the shadow does most of the communicating.

**Reduced motion:** honor `prefers-reduced-motion`. Keep opacity transitions, remove the rise and the stagger. Shadow changes remain, since they carry state.

## Components

### Buttons
`button-primary` is an indigo fill at `{rounded.md}` with `{elevation.1}`, lifting on hover and flattening on press. `button-secondary` is white with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` border and the same elevation behavior. `button-ghost` is indigo text with a tinted hover fill. Buttons are 38px tall by default and 44px on touch.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is white at `{rounded.md}` with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` border, turning indigo on focus with a 3px focus ring at low opacity. Labels sit above in `{typography.heading-sm}`, helper text below in `{typography.caption}`, and errors below that in `{colors.negative}` with an icon. Form groups are separated by `{spacing.xl}` with no fieldset borders.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is a white surface at `{rounded.lg}` with a hairline border, `{elevation.1}`, and `{spacing.xl}` padding. The border and shadow work together: the border defines the edge crisply at any zoom, and the shadow does the lifting. `nav-bar` is flat at rest and gains `{elevation.2}` once the page scrolls beneath it. The active item is indigo text on an 8% indigo tint at `{rounded.md}`.

### Data
`table-row` uses `{typography.body-sm}` with `{colors.hairline}` bottom rules. Figures switch to `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`, right-aligned. Hover fills with `{colors.surface-sunken}`; selection fills with a 12% indigo tint and adds a 2px indigo inline-start border. Headers are `{typography.overline}` on a `{colors.surface-sunken}` fill, sticky on scroll.

### Feedback
`badge` is a `{colors.surface-sunken}` chip at `{rounded.sm}`; semantic variants use a 12% tint of their color with the solid color as text. `toast` is a white card at `{elevation.2}` with a hairline border and a 3px colored inline-start edge, entering from the bottom with a 4px rise. `modal` is `{rounded.xl}` at `{elevation.3}` over a `{colors.text-primary}` overlay at 36% opacity, unblurred, entering with a 4px rise and a fade.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | 3+9 app shell; sidebar persistent; cards 3-up |
| `lg` | 1024–1439px | Sidebar persistent but narrower; cards 2-up |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Sidebar collapses to a drawer; cards 2-up |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; bottom tab bar; display-xl to 32px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 50 → 32px, display-lg 36 → 26px, heading-lg 26 → 21px. Body stays at 15px.

**Shadows soften on small screens:** `{elevation.2}` reduces its blur from 18px to 12px so cards do not appear to float off a narrow viewport.

**Card radius** drops from 12px to 10px at `sm`, keeping the proportion sensible against reduced padding.

**Touch targets** reach 44pt: button height moves from 38px to 44px and list rows from 44px to 48px.

**Native specifics:** dark-content status bar. `elevationModel: material` means Android maps levels 0 to 3 onto Material elevations 0, 1, 6 and 12, while iOS uses the shadow strings; the inset highlight is dropped on Android, where Material elevation already carries the light model. Modals are bottom sheets with a grab handle on both platforms. Haptics fire on primary actions, selection changes, and destructive confirmations. Dynamic Type is honored with layouts reflowing to single-column at the largest sizes.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Pair every shadow with the inset 1px top highlight.
- Keep to exactly three surface levels.
- Use accent tints at 8 to 12 percent for hover and selected states.
- Let cards carry both a hairline border and a soft shadow; each does a different job.
- Enter elements with a 4px rise and a fade, staggering lists at 40ms.
- Give nested elements a radius at least 4px smaller than their parent.
- Use a single font family so web and native stay consistent.

### Don't
- Don't use backdrop blur. It is expensive, hurts text rendering, and reads as generic.
- Don't add a fourth layer; flatten the nesting instead.
- Don't use purple gradients or any gradient as a page background.
- Don't push shadow opacity above 16%; layers should sit, not detach.
- Don't introduce a second accent hue; use tints of the one accent.
- Don't apply the lit top edge to elements that are not raised.
- Don't animate the shadow and the position with different durations; they must move together.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#f6f7fa` · Surface `#ffffff` · Ink `#15181f` / `#5a6172` · Indigo `#3355e0` · Shadow plus `inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.9)` · Radius 8 controls / 12 cards / 18 modals · General Sans 400/600 · Spline Sans Mono figures.

**Building a screen:**

> Build this in the Soft Depth system. Light cool canvas `#f6f7fa`, white surfaces with a 1px `#e3e6ef` border and `box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(21,24,31,0.05), inset 0 1px 0 rgba(255,255,255,0.9)`. That inset highlight goes on every raised surface. Exactly three layers: canvas, surface, raised. General Sans at 400 and 600 only; body 15px at 1.6 line-height. Indigo `#3355e0` for primary actions, with 8 to 12 percent tints for hover and selected states. Radius 8px on controls, 12px on cards, 18px on modals. Elements enter with a 4px rise and a fade over 240ms, lists staggered at 40ms. No backdrop blur anywhere.

**Building a card grid:**

> Cards on white at 12px radius with a 1px `#e3e6ef` border and level-1 shadow plus the inset highlight. On hover, move to level 2 (`0 6px 18px rgba(21,24,31,0.08)`) and translate up 1px, animating shadow and position together over 240ms. Card title in General Sans 20px weight 600, body 15px weight 400 in `#5a6172`. 32px internal padding, 20px grid gutter.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Every shadow carries the inset 1px top highlight; that pairing is the depth.
2. Three layers, never four.
3. No backdrop blur, and tints of the one accent instead of new colors.
