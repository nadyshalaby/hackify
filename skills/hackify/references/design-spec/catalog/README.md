# Catalog (twelve ready-to-drop design specs)

Twelve complete `DESIGN.md` files, one per direction in [direction-library.md](../direction-library.md), each conforming to [spec-contract.md](../spec-contract.md).

All original work. None reproduces a real company's identity, name, wordmark, or proprietary palette. Every font named is freely licensed and installable today, and every file carries a fallback stack that renders on a stock machine with no network access.

Each spec's contrast ratios for `text-primary`, `text-secondary`, and `on-accent` are computed, stated in its Colors section, and pass WCAG AA.

## Pick one

| Spec | Mode | Reads as | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| [industrial-precision](industrial-precision.md) | dark | engineered, exact, unsentimental | Developer tools, infrastructure dashboards, trading and ops consoles, B2B admin |
| [editorial-print](editorial-print.md) | light | authored, considered, worth reading | Publications, long-form docs, research sites, idea-led marketing |
| [retro-terminal](retro-terminal.md) | dark | direct, expert, no hand-holding | CLIs and their web companions, self-hosted tooling, security products |
| [warm-organic](warm-organic.md) | light | human, unhurried, safe | Health and wellness, community and education, finance for non-experts |
| [brutalist-mono](brutalist-mono.md) | light | honest, loud, uninterested in charming you | Portfolios, agencies, launch and event sites, music and culture |
| [neo-luxury](neo-luxury.md) | dark | scarce, slow, expensive | Premium commerce, hospitality, private banking, membership products |
| [swiss-grid](swiss-grid.md) | light | rational, ordered, neutral | Institutions, universities, design-system docs, professional services |
| [data-dense](data-dense.md) | dark | professional, information-first, earned | Analytics, trading and risk, observability, logistics, power-user admin |
| [playful-pop](playful-pop.md) | light | energetic, tactile, low-stakes | Consumer mobile, kids and education, games and community, habit tracking |
| [nordic-calm](nordic-calm.md) | light | quiet, focused, unbothered | Writing and notes, focus and productivity, reading apps, meditation |
| [cyber-neon](cyber-neon.md) | dark | charged, kinetic, after-hours | Gaming and esports, streaming and creator tools, crypto, security |
| [soft-depth](soft-depth.md) | light | modern, layered, approachable | General-purpose product UI, consumer SaaS, cross-platform apps |

Six dark-canonical, six light-canonical. Nine cover web and native; `editorial-print`, `retro-terminal`, `brutalist-mono` and `swiss-grid` are web-only, since their identities depend on layout and typographic devices that do not transfer to native chrome.

## Use one in a project

1. **Choose** a spec from the table. When two fit, read each one's Overview and Don'ts; the Don'ts usually decide it, because they name what the product must never look like.
2. **Copy** it to `<project>/docs/design/DESIGN.md`.
3. **Adapt the identity, keep the system.** Change the palette values to the product's own colors while keeping the *palette logic*: the same number of roles, the same accent budget, the same relationships. Swap fonts only for equivalents with matching proportions. Do not change the token structure, the required roles, or the component list.
4. **Update the header**: set `name` to the product, keep `direction`, and rewrite `description` for the product.
5. **Recompute the contrast ratios** after any palette change and update the Colors section. The stated ratios must be true.
6. **Generate the preview** from [`../../../assets/design-preview-template.html`](../../../assets/design-preview-template.html) and commit it beside the spec.
7. **Validate** against the checklist at the end of [spec-contract.md](../spec-contract.md).

`/hackify:designify` runs this whole sequence, including the extraction path when the project already has tokens.

## What these are not

- **Not themes.** Copying a spec does not restyle a codebase. It states the contract the code must then be written against.
- **Not interchangeable.** Swapping directions mid-project is a rebrand, not a config change. Every component's states, motion, and depth model are tuned to its direction.
- **Not exhaustive.** Twelve directions do not cover every product. When none fits, author a fresh spec against the contract and set `direction: custom` with a written rationale.

## Reading them as worked examples

Each spec is also a demonstration of the contract, which makes the catalog useful even when none is adopted:

- **industrial-precision**, the fullest treatment of tabular numerics and hairline-based structure.
- **retro-terminal**, how to write a spec where a whole token category is deliberately null (every radius and elevation is zero).
- **swiss-grid**, how to specify a grid so precisely that it replaces the depth system.
- **data-dense**, how to specify density without losing accessibility, and how to spec charts.
- **cyber-neon**, how to write anti-tells that keep a direction clear of an adjacent cliché.
- **soft-depth**, how to achieve a layered effect without the expensive technique everyone reaches for first.
