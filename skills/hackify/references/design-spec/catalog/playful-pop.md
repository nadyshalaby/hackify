description: >
  Tactile, saturated, and unafraid to be fun. Three saturated hues used at full
  strength across large blocks, chunky geometry with thick dark borders, and hard
  offset shadows that shorten when an element is pressed. Every interactive element
  visibly compresses and rebounds, so the interface feels physically clickable.
  Built for products where the stakes are low and the reward is the interaction.

## Overview

This system wants to be poked. Shapes are chunky, borders are 2px of near-black, and every raised element carries a hard offset shadow in that same near-black, so components look like they have mass. Nothing is subtle and nothing pretends to be, which is the correct register for a product where the worst outcome of a wrong tap is a moment of amusement.

The interaction model is the design. Press any interactive element and it translates by its shadow offset while the shadow disappears, so the element is pushed flat into the page and springs back on release. Combined with a spring easing curve that visibly overshoots, this makes the entire interface feel physical. Users tap things here because tapping is satisfying, which is a legitimate design goal.

Color is loud but strictly bounded: **three hues and no more**. Coral `{colors.accent}` is the primary action, sun `{colors.accent-two}` is highlights and badges, and sky `{colors.accent-three}` is information and focus. Each hue means the same thing everywhere. The failure mode of this direction is a fourth and fifth hue arriving for variety, at which point the screen becomes noise and no color means anything.

**Signature moves:**
- The press response: translate by the shadow offset, remove the shadow, spring back.
- Hard offset shadows in near-black with zero blur, at 3, 5 and 8px.
- 2px near-black borders on every raised element, including inputs.
- Exactly three saturated hues, each with one fixed meaning.
- Spring easing with a visible overshoot on entry and settle.
- Chunky radii, 12 to 36px, scaled to element size.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent

This is the one spec in the catalog with **three accents rather than one**, and the reason is documented here rather than assumed: the direction encodes meaning through hue, so a single accent would force meaning back onto shape and position, which chunky components cannot carry finely enough.

- **Coral** (`{colors.accent}` — `#ff6b47`): the primary action, always. Contrast against `{colors.on-accent}` near-black is 6.37:1.
- **Coral Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}` — `#ff8365`, `{colors.accent-press}` — `#e5512e`).
- **Sun** (`{colors.accent-two}` — `#ffc233`): badges, highlights, streaks and rewards, selected states.
- **Sky** (`{colors.accent-three}` — `#2f9fd4`): informational surfaces, focus rings, toasts.

All three take `{colors.text-primary}` near-black as their foreground, never white. Dark text on a saturated fill is what keeps this palette from turning into a children's toy.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#fff8ec`): warm cream page background.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}` — `#ffffff`): cards, inputs, modals.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}` — `#ffeeda`): hover fills, disabled fills, quiet blocks.
- **Hairline** and **Hairline Strong** (both `#1a1614`): identical by design. Borders in this system are always near-black, always 2px.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.text-primary}` — `#1a1614`): everything, including text on colored fills. Contrast on canvas 17.02:1.
- **Ink Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}` — `#5e534c`): supporting copy. Contrast 7.06:1.
- **Ink Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — `#9b8e84`): disabled and placeholder only.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#1f9e56`), **Caution** (identical to `{colors.accent-two}` sun, since a highlight and a caution are the same visual event here), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#e5382b`). All are flat fills with near-black borders and near-black text, matching every other component.

**Contrast rule specific to this direction.** The three hues and the three semantic colors are **fill colors, never text colors**. Each is measured for contrast against the near-black `{colors.text-primary}` that sits on top of it, not against the canvas. Coral on near-black is 6.37:1 and sun is higher still. Setting any of them as text on `{colors.canvas}` would fail AA, so the spec forbids it: error and status messages use `{colors.text-primary}` text on a semantic fill, or `{colors.text-primary}` text beside a semantic-filled icon. This is the opposite of the convention in the light-canvas specs elsewhere in the catalog, and it is deliberate.

## Typography

### Font Family

`Bricolage Grotesque` is a variable display face with width, weight, and optical-size axes and deliberately irregular proportions: the letterforms are slightly off-model in a way that reads as hand-drawn confidence rather than error. At weight 800 with tight negative tracking it produces headlines with real personality, which is what carries the tone before any color is seen.

`Outfit` carries body copy. It is a geometric sans with circular bowls and even weight distribution, friendly without being cute, and it stays quiet under the display face. `Azeret Mono` handles figures and overlines; its slightly squared forms fit the chunky geometry better than a conventional mono.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 64px | 800 | 1 | -2px | Page hero |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 44px | 800 | 1.05 | -1.2px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 30px | 700 | 1.15 | -0.5px | Card or screen title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 22px | 700 | 1.25 | -0.2px | Sub-section |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 17px | 700 | 1.35 | 0 | Group label (body face) |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Supporting text |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 | Helper text |
| `{typography.overline}` | 12px | 600 | 1.2 | 0.06em | Mono uppercase labels |
| `{typography.button}` | 17px | 700 | 1 | 0 | Button labels, deliberately large |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 15px | 500 | 1.45 | -0.02em | Figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Button text is large.** 17px bold, bigger than body copy. A chunky button with small text looks empty.
- **Weight 800 on display, 700 on headings.** Light weights have no place in this system.
- **Bricolage stays above 22px.** Its irregularities read as mistakes at small sizes.
- **Sentence case, never Title Case.** The tone is conversational.
- **No text on a colored fill except near-black.** White text on coral both fails contrast and softens the look.

## Layout

**Base unit: 4px**, with a chunky spatial scale: 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 36 / 56 / 96. Small values below 8px exist only for border-adjacent nudges.

**Container** maxes at 1200px. Content is generously padded because chunky components need room to avoid colliding shadows.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a 24px gutter, but layouts stay simple: full width, halves, or thirds. Complex asymmetric grids fight the boldness of the components sitting on them.

**Shadow clearance matters.** Every raised element casts a hard offset shadow up to 8px down and toward the inline end. Layouts must leave at least that much clearance, or shadows overlap neighbours and the whole composition looks dirty. This is the most common layout error in this direction.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Generous between sections at 96px, comfortable inside components at 24px. The components themselves are heavy, so the space around them needs to be real.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is the **hard offset block**, and it is also the interaction model.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Pressed states, disabled elements |
| 1 | `3px 3px 0 0` near-black | Focused inputs, small chips |
| 2 | `5px 5px 0 0` near-black | Buttons, toasts at rest |
| 3 | `8px 8px 0 0` near-black | Cards, modals, hovered buttons |

**No shadow in this system is ever blurred.** A blurred shadow reads as a different design language and immediately flattens the physicality.

The **press interaction** is the core: on press, translate the element by its shadow offset (down and toward the inline end), set elevation to 0, and scale to 0.97. On release, spring back with the overshoot easing. The whole cycle runs in 90ms down and 260ms back.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 8px | Checkboxes, small chips |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 12px | Buttons, inputs, small cards |
| `{rounded.md}` | 16px | Medium containers |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 24px | Cards, panels |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 36px | Modals, sheets, hero containers |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Badges, avatars, ghost buttons, progress tracks |

Radius scales with element size, as in `warm-organic`, but the values are larger and paired with hard borders rather than soft shadows, which is what separates chunky from soft.

**Imagery** sits at `{rounded.lg}` with a 2px near-black border and often a hard offset shadow, cropped square or 4:3. Illustration works well here: flat, bold, using the three hues with near-black outlines that match the component borders. Icons are 2.5px stroke with rounded caps on a 24px grid, and they are always outlined in the same near-black as the borders.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 90ms | Press down |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 160ms | Hover, color change |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 260ms | Press release with spring, card entry |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 380ms | Modal and sheet entry |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 560ms | Page-load stagger |

The `enter` and `move` easing is `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`, a genuine spring with visible overshoot. This is stronger than the gentle settle in `warm-organic` and it is the difference between the two directions in motion terms.

**Motion belongs to interactions, not to page transitions.** A springy page transition is disorienting; a springy button press is delightful. Keep the physics on the elements the user touches.

**Page-load stagger:** hero elements enter with a spring and a 12px rise, staggered at 70ms, capped at six elements.

**Reduced motion:** honor `prefers-reduced-motion`. Remove the spring overshoot, the press scale, and the translation; keep color changes and the shadow state change, so pressing still gives feedback.

## Components

### Buttons
Every button has a 2px near-black border, a `{rounded.sm}` radius, an offset shadow, and large 17px bold text. `button-primary` is coral. `button-secondary` is white. `button-ghost` is a pill with no border or shadow, for tertiary actions. Buttons are chunky by default: minimum 44px tall on web, 48px on native.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a white field with the same 2px near-black border as everything else, flat at rest and gaining a `{elevation.1}` shadow plus a 3px sky focus ring when focused. Labels sit above in `{typography.heading-sm}`. Errors appear below in `{colors.negative}` with an icon. Checkboxes and radios are chunky: 24px with a 2px border and a bold check mark, and they animate in with a spring.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is a white block at `{rounded.lg}` with a 2px border and an 8px offset shadow. `nav-bar` is a row with a 2px bottom border; the active item is a `{rounded.pill}` sun-colored fill with a near-black border. On native, the tab bar sits above the safe area with the same treatment.

### Data
Tables are secondary here. `table-row` uses 2px near-black bottom borders, which is heavy for a table but consistent with the system, so tables should be short. Figures use `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`. For longer datasets, stacked cards work better than a table in this direction.

### Feedback
`badge` is a pill with a sun fill, near-black border, and mono uppercase text. `toast` is a sky-filled block with a border and offset shadow, entering with a spring from the bottom. `modal` is a `{rounded.xl}` white sheet with a 2px border and an 8px offset shadow over a `{colors.text-primary}` overlay at 40% opacity, unblurred, entering with a spring and a scale from 0.94.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Full layout; shadows at 8px; display-xl at 64px |
| `lg` | 1024–1439px | Layout holds; shadows at 8px |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Two-column maximum; shadows drop to 5px |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; shadows drop to 3px; display-xl to 36px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 64 → 36px, display-lg 44 → 28px, heading-lg 30 → 24px. Body stays at 16px and button text stays at 17px, because shrinking button text undermines the chunky feel.

**Shadow offsets scale down** with the viewport so cards do not consume narrow screens, but they never go below 3px and never become blurred.

**Border width stays 2px** at every breakpoint.

**Touch targets** are 48pt minimum on native, and the press animation is where haptics fire. This direction uses more haptic feedback than any other in the catalog: primary actions, selection changes, and toggles all fire, because the tactile layer reinforces the physical metaphor the visuals are building.

**Native specifics:** dark-content status bar. Modals are bottom sheets with a chunky grab handle and spring dismissal. Dynamic Type is honored; chunky components have enough padding to absorb larger text without reflowing.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Give every raised element a 2px near-black border and a zero-blur offset shadow.
- Make the press interaction physical: translate, flatten the shadow, spring back.
- Keep to exactly three hues, each with one fixed meaning.
- Use near-black text on every colored fill.
- Leave shadow clearance in the layout so offsets do not overlap neighbours.
- Make buttons chunky, with 17px bold labels and 44px minimum height.
- Fire haptics on presses, toggles, and selection changes.

### Don't
- Don't add a fourth hue for variety; three is the system.
- Don't use rainbow gradients anywhere.
- Don't blur a shadow.
- Don't put white text on the coral or sun fills.
- Don't apply spring motion to page transitions; it belongs to interactions.
- Don't let emoji do the work color and shape should do.
- Don't use this direction for dense data; the components are too heavy for long tables.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#fff8ec` · Surface `#ffffff` · Ink `#1a1614` · Coral `#ff6b47` · Sun `#ffc233` · Sky `#2f9fd4` · Border 2px ink · Shadow `Npx Npx 0 0` ink · Radius 12/24/36 · Bricolage Grotesque 800, Outfit body, Azeret Mono figures.

**Building a screen:**

> Build this in the Playful Pop system. Warm cream canvas `#fff8ec`, white cards with 2px `#1a1614` borders and hard offset shadows `8px 8px 0 0 #1a1614`, zero blur. Headline in Bricolage Grotesque 800 at 64px, tracking -2px. Body in Outfit 16px. Three hues only: coral `#ff6b47` for primary actions, sun `#ffc233` for badges and highlights, sky `#2f9fd4` for info and focus rings. Near-black text on every colored fill. Radius 12px on buttons, 24px on cards, 36px on modals. On press: translate by the shadow offset, remove the shadow, scale to 0.97, then spring back with `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` over 260ms. Leave 8px of shadow clearance around every raised element.

**Building a button:**

> 2px `#1a1614` border, 12px radius, coral `#ff6b47` fill, near-black label in Outfit 17px bold, 44px minimum height, `5px 5px 0 0 #1a1614` shadow at rest growing to 8px on hover and collapsing to none on press with a 3px translate and 0.97 scale.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Three hues, each with one fixed meaning.
2. Zero-blur offset shadows plus 2px borders; the press flattens both.
3. Near-black text on every colored fill.
