  The interface gets out of the way and stays out of the way. Cool off-whites,
  a soft near-black that never reaches true black, and an accent so muted it
  barely registers as color and appears once per view at most. Whitespace is the
  only structural device: sections are separated by 96px of nothing, with no rule,
  no card, and no background change. The user's own content is the only thing with presence.

## Overview

This system is designed to be forgotten while it is being used. `{colors.canvas}` is a cool off-white with the faintest green cast, text is `{colors.text-primary}`, a soft near-black that never reaches true black, and the accent `{colors.accent}` is a desaturated slate blue that most people would not describe as a color at all.

Whitespace is the only structural device. Sections are separated by `{spacing.huge}` 96px of nothing: no rule, no card, no background change, no divider. That is a genuine constraint rather than a stylistic preference, and it forces the content hierarchy to be correct, because there is nothing else holding the page together. When a layout in this system feels confusing, the fix is always in the content order or the type scale, never in adding a border.

The accent appears **once per view at most**. In a writing tool, that is the save indicator. In a reading app, it is the current position. Adding a second accent for variety breaks the whole premise: this direction works because the one colored thing on screen is unambiguous.

**Signature moves:**
- 96px of empty space as the only section separator, with no rule or card.
- One accent appearance per view, in a color that barely reads as color.
- Shadows so soft they read as light rather than depth, at 4 to 11% opacity.
- Generous 1.7 line-height with the measure capped at 68 characters.
- Cross-fades instead of movement, with at most a 2px settle.
- Borderless cards that are defined by a whisper of shadow and nothing else.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Slate** (`{colors.accent}`, `#4a6b74`): the single accent. The primary button, the active navigation item, the focus ring, the one indicator that matters. Contrast against white is 5.76:1. Once per view.
- **Slate Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}`, `#577c86`, `{colors.accent-press}`, `#3b565e`).

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}`, `#f7f8f7`): the page, a cool off-white.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}`, `#ffffff`): cards, inputs, modals, sitting a shade brighter than the page.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}`, `#eceeec`): hover fills, badges, disabled states.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}`, `#e2e5e3`): used only inside tables and lists, never between sections.
- **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}`, `#ccd2cf`): input and secondary-button borders.

### Text
- **Charcoal** (`{colors.text-primary}`, `#1f2421`): headings and body. Contrast on canvas 14.80:1.
- **Charcoal Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}`, `#5f6a66`): supporting copy, navigation, metadata. Contrast 5.27:1.
- **Charcoal Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}`, `#8b9591`): placeholders, disabled, timestamps.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}`, `#4c7a5a`), **Caution** (`{colors.caution}`, `#7d6226`), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}`, `#a05248`). All desaturated to sit within the palette's quietness. A semantic color appearing counts against the one-accent budget for that view, since two colored elements on a near-colorless screen compete regardless of what they mean.

## Typography

### Font Family

One family, `Hanken Grotesk`, at weights 400, 500 and 600. A single family is right here for the same reason a single accent is: variety would create visual events, and this system is built to have as few of those as possible.

`Hanken Grotesk` is a humanist grotesque with slightly narrow proportions, a tall x-height, and gently rounded terminals. It is quiet without being characterless, which is a harder balance than it sounds and the reason a more neutral face would leave the system feeling unfinished rather than calm.

`Geist Mono` handles figures. Its low-contrast, evenly-spaced forms keep numbers from becoming visual events in a page of prose.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 46px | 500 | 1.2 | -0.8px | Page title |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 34px | 500 | 1.25 | -0.5px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 25px | 500 | 1.3 | -0.2px | Sub-section |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 19px | 500 | 1.4 | 0 | Card title |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 16px | 600 | 1.45 | 0 | Group label |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.75 | 0 | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.7 | 0 | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 | Metadata, table cells |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Helper text |
| `{typography.overline}` | 12px | 600 | 1.3 | 0.08em | Uppercase label, used sparingly |
| `{typography.button}` | 15px | 600 | 1 | 0 | Button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 15px | 400 | 1.6 | -0.01em | Figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Weight 500 on display, not 600 or 700.** Heavy headings are visual events, and this system avoids them. The hierarchy comes from size and space.
- **Line-height 1.7 on body, never below 1.6.** Along with the measure cap, this is what makes long reading sessions comfortable.
- **Measure caps at 68 characters.** On wide screens the margin grows and the column does not.
- **Overlines are rare.** Most sections need no label at all; the space above them already says a new section began.
- **Sentence case everywhere.** Uppercase is a raised voice.

## Layout

**Base unit: 4px**, with a scale that jumps generously at the top: 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 40 / 64 / 96.

**Container** maxes at 1040px, and the text column inside it stays near 640px. The container exists to hold occasional wider elements; text never uses its full width.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a 24px gutter, but most layouts are a single centered column. When a second column is needed it is a narrow 3-column rail for metadata, separated by space rather than by a rule.

**Whitespace philosophy.** This is the entire layout system. `{spacing.huge}` 96px between major sections, `{spacing.xxl}` 64px between subsections, `{spacing.xl}` 40px inside cards, `{spacing.lg}` 24px between related elements. Those four values applied consistently do all the work that borders, cards, and background changes do elsewhere. Nothing else is needed and adding anything else is a regression.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is **soft light**, applied so lightly it is nearly subliminal.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Sections, most content |
| 1 | `{elevation.1}` at 4% opacity | Cards |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` at 7% opacity | Toasts, dropdowns |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` at 11% opacity | Modals |

Shadow opacities are the lowest in the catalog. `{elevation.1}` should be barely detectable, enough to lift a white card off an off-white canvas and no more. If a shadow here is visible as a shadow, it is too strong.

**Cards carry no border.** The combination of a white surface on an off-white canvas plus a 4% shadow is the entire card definition. A border would be a hard edge, and hard edges are visual events.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 3px | Checkboxes, small chips |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 5px | Badges, tags |
| `{rounded.md}` | 7px | Buttons, inputs |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 10px | Cards, images |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 14px | Modals |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Avatars only |

Radii are moderate and unremarkable on purpose. Very round reads as friendly and very square reads as technical; this system wants neither register.

**Imagery** sits at `{rounded.lg}` with no border and no shadow. Photography should be low-contrast and quiet, with plenty of negative space in the image itself. A high-contrast, saturated photograph will dominate a page in this system in a way it would not elsewhere. Icons are 1.5px stroke on a 20px grid in `{colors.text-secondary}`, used only where genuinely faster to read than a word.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 120ms | Color changes |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 200ms | Button and input states |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 300ms | Cross-fades, content changes |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 420ms | Modal entry |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 600ms | Page-load fade |

**Cross-fade rather than move.** When content changes, the old content fades out and the new fades in. Translation is limited to a 2px settle, which is at the edge of perception and exists only to suggest that something arrived rather than appeared.

**No scroll-triggered animation, no stagger, no parallax.** A page loads with a single 600ms fade of the whole content area. Sequential reveals are a form of demanding attention, and this system does not demand attention.

**Reduced motion:** cross-fades remain, the 2px settle is removed. Nothing else changes because there is nothing else.

## Components

### Buttons
`button-primary` is a slate fill with white text at `{rounded.md}`, and there is one per view. `button-secondary` is a hairline outline on a transparent background, which is the default for almost every action. `button-ghost` is bare secondary-colored text. Buttons are modest: 15px labels, 38px tall, no shadow.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a white field with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` border at `{rounded.md}`, turning slate on focus with a 2px focus ring. Labels sit above in `{typography.heading-sm}`, helper text below in `{typography.caption}`. Forms are spaced at `{spacing.lg}` between fields and `{spacing.xl}` between groups, with no group boxes or fieldset borders.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is a white surface at `{rounded.lg}` with `{spacing.xl}` padding, a 4% shadow, and no border. `nav-bar` has no border, no shadow, and no background change on scroll; it simply sits on the canvas. Items are `{colors.text-secondary}` and the active item is `{colors.accent}`, which is usually the single accent appearance on the view.

### Data
Tables are quiet: `{typography.body-sm}` with `{colors.hairline}` bottom rules and generous padding. Figures use `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`. No zebra striping, no vertical rules, no header fill. The header row is `{typography.overline}` with a slightly stronger bottom rule.

### Feedback
`badge` is a `{colors.surface-sunken}` chip with no border in `{typography.overline}`. `toast` is a white card at `{elevation.2}` with a hairline border, bottom-center, dismissing after 5 seconds with a cross-fade. `modal` is a `{rounded.xl}` white surface at `{elevation.3}` over a `{colors.text-primary}` overlay at 24% opacity, which is lighter than most systems use, unblurred.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Centered column with wide margins; optional metadata rail |
| `lg` | 1024-1439px | Rail narrows; margins reduce |
| `md` | 768-1023px | Rail moves below content |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; display-xl to 30px; rhythm to 56px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 46 → 30px, display-lg 34 → 24px, heading-lg 25 → 20px. Body stays at 16px and line-height stays at 1.7.

**Section rhythm** drops from 96px to 56px, which is still generous. It is the last value to compress, because whitespace is the structure and compressing it removes the structure.

**Margins** shrink from wide to 20px at `sm`, with the text column then filling the available width at a measure of roughly 40 characters, which is acceptable at that size.

**Touch targets** reach 44pt by increasing vertical padding on buttons and list rows.

**Native specifics:** dark-content status bar on the light canvas. Haptics fire on destructive confirmations only, because frequent haptic feedback is stimulating and this system is deliberately unstimulating. Modals present as sheets with a slow cross-fade. Dynamic Type is honored fully, with the measure cap expressed in characters so it adapts as text scales.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Separate sections with 96px of empty space and nothing else.
- Keep the accent to one appearance per view.
- Use shadows at 4 to 11% opacity so they read as light rather than depth.
- Cap the measure at 68 characters and let the margin absorb the rest.
- Keep display weights at 500.
- Cross-fade content changes instead of moving them.
- Let the user's own content be the only thing with visual presence.

### Don't
- Don't add a second accent for variety; it breaks the premise.
- Don't put borders or visible shadows on cards.
- Don't add dividers, rules, or background changes between sections.
- Don't use warm colors; the whole palette is cool.
- Don't add scroll-triggered reveals or staggered entrances.
- Don't compress line-height or section rhythm to fit more content.
- Don't use high-contrast saturated photography; it will dominate the page.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#f7f8f7` · Surface `#ffffff` · Charcoal `#1f2421` / `#5f6a66` · Slate `#4a6b74` · Shadows 4 to 11% opacity · Section rhythm 96px · Measure 68ch · Hanken Grotesk 400/500/600 · Geist Mono figures.

**Building a screen:**

> Build this in the Nordic Calm system. Cool off-white canvas `#f7f8f7`, white cards with no border and a 4%-opacity shadow `0 1px 3px rgba(31,36,33,0.04)`. Hanken Grotesk throughout: headings at weight 500, body at 400, 16px with 1.7 line-height and a measure capped at 68 characters. Separate every section with 96px of empty space and no rule, no card, no background change. Exactly one slate `#4a6b74` element on the entire view. Radius 7px on controls, 10px on cards. Content changes cross-fade over 300ms with at most a 2px settle; no scroll animation, no stagger, no parallax.

**Building a form:**

> Fields on white at 7px radius with a 1px `#ccd2cf` border turning `#4a6b74` on focus with a 2px ring. Labels above in Hanken Grotesk 16px weight 600. 24px between fields, 40px between groups, with no fieldset borders or group boxes. Submit as the single slate button; every other action is a hairline outline or bare text.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Whitespace is the only separator; no rules, no cards between sections.
2. One accent appearance per view.
3. Shadows read as light, never as depth.
