  The page came first. Warm paper white, near-black ink, and a single oxblood
  accent reserved for links and rules. Type carries the entire hierarchy with a
  four-fold jump from display to body, set flush left with a ragged right. Cards
  are rare and outlined rather than shadowed. Content is separated by whitespace
  and hairline rules, the way a well-set magazine separates a standfirst from a body.

## Overview

This system is built on the assumption that someone edited the thing you are reading. Warm paper white, `{colors.canvas}`, holds the field. Ink is `{colors.text-primary}`, a near-black that is deliberately not `#000` because true black on warm paper reads as printing error rather than type. Structure comes from whitespace and hairline rules, not from boxes: a page here has almost no containers on it.

Color is scarce on purpose. Oxblood `{colors.accent}` appears on links, on rules that mark a section boundary, and on the single primary action. Everything else is ink, paper, and the greys between them. When an editorial page needs visual weight it reaches for a photograph or a headline, never for a colored panel.

The type does the rest. `Playfair Display` sets the headline at a size that would be uncomfortable in most systems and is correct here: the jump from `{typography.display-xl}` at 68px to `{typography.body-md}` at 17px is four-fold, and that ratio is what makes a page read as authored rather than assembled. Body copy runs at 17px with 1.7 line-height and a measure capped near 68 characters, because the job is sustained reading rather than scanning.

**Signature moves:**
- The asymmetric opening: headline flush against a wide left margin, image breaking the grid on one side, standfirst establishing rhythm before the body.
- A four-fold display-to-body size jump, never a timid 1.5x.
- Flush left, ragged right, always. Nothing is centered and nothing is justified.
- Oxblood reserved for links, section rules, and one primary action.
- Hairline rules and 112px section gaps instead of cards.
- Near-zero radius (4px maximum) so nothing reads as an app component.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Oxblood** (`{colors.accent}` — `#7a2118`): inline links, section rules, the single primary action, and drop caps. Contrast on canvas is 9.70:1, so it is safe as body-size link text.
- **Oxblood Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}` — `#96291d`, `{colors.accent-press}` — `#5c1812`): interactive states only.
- **On Accent** (`{colors.on-accent}` — `#fbf9f4`): paper white on the oxblood fill.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#fbf9f4`): the page. Warm, never pure white.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}` — `#ffffff`): the rare card or modal, deliberately brighter than the page so it reads as a laid-on element.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}` — `#f2eee5`): pull quotes, code blocks, table row hover.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#e0d9cc`) and **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#c4baa8`): rules between sections and under inputs. These carry all the structure the layout has.

### Text
- **Ink** (`{colors.text-primary}` — `#141210`): body and headlines. Contrast 17.76:1.
- **Ink Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}` — `#5a544c`): standfirsts, captions, bylines. Contrast 7.11:1.
- **Ink Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — `#8a8278`): datelines, credits, disabled states.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#2f6b46`), **Caution** (`{colors.caution}` — `#8a6410`), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#a3271a`). All muted toward ink so they sit inside the page's warmth. Negative is close to the accent in hue and must never appear as a link color, or readers will click errors.

## Typography

### Font Family

`Playfair Display` is a high-contrast transitional serif with sharp, thin hairlines that only work at large sizes. That constraint is a feature: it forces the display tier to stay large, which is exactly what this direction wants. Below 24px it is never used.

`Source Serif 4` carries body copy. It is a low-contrast text serif designed for screen reading, with a large x-height and open counters that hold up at 15px. Pairing a display serif with a text serif is unusual and is the point: the two faces share a skeleton but disagree about contrast, so hierarchy is legible without a change of voice.

`IBM Plex Mono` handles overlines, figures, and code. Its appearance is a deliberate tonal break, marking machine-set information inside a hand-set page.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 68px | 700 | 1.02 | -1.6px | Article headline, one per page |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 46px | 700 | 1.08 | -1px | Section opener, feature title |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 32px | 600 | 1.15 | -0.4px | Sub-head within an article |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 24px | 600 | 1.25 | -0.2px | Card title, sidebar heading |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 18px | 600 | 1.35 | 0 | Inline sub-head (body face) |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 20px | 400 | 1.65 | 0 | Standfirst, lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 17px | 400 | 1.7 | 0 | Article body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 15px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 | Sidebars, navigation, captions |
| `{typography.caption}` | 14px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 | Image credits, footnotes |
| `{typography.overline}` | 12px | 500 | 1.2 | 0.14em | Mono uppercase section label |
| `{typography.button}` | 16px | 600 | 1 | 0 | Button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 15px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Figures and data, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Flush left, ragged right.** Never justified (rivers destroy the texture at these measures), never centered except for a standalone pull quote.
- **Measure caps at 68 characters.** On wide screens the column stays narrow and the margin grows. Full-width body text is the fastest way to make this system look wrong.
- **The display tier is large or absent.** If a headline cannot be set at 46px or more, use `{typography.heading-lg}` in the body face instead of shrinking Playfair.
- **Optical margin on the opening.** The headline's first character aligns to the margin optically, not mechanically; quotes and capital T or W hang slightly outside.
- **One drop cap per article, maximum.** Three lines deep, in `{colors.accent}`.

## Layout

**Base unit: 4px**, but the useful rhythm is larger: `{spacing.lg}` 20px inside components, `{spacing.xl}` 32px between them, `{spacing.xxl}` 56px between subsections, `{spacing.huge}` 112px between major sections. That large top step is what gives the page air.

**Container** maxes at 1180px, but the *text column* is much narrower, roughly 640px. The container width exists so that images and pull quotes can break wider than the text they interrupt.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a 32px gutter. The canonical article layout is an asymmetric 7+4 with one empty column: body copy in columns 1 through 7, marginalia and captions in 9 through 12. Images break to 1 through 10 or full-bleed. Equal halves are avoided; they read as a web page rather than a page.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Space is not padding, it is punctuation. A 112px gap tells the reader a new argument begins; a 32px gap tells them the same argument continues. Consistency in those two values matters more than the values themselves.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is **the rule and the margin**. This system is nearly flat by design.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat, hairline rule or nothing | Everything on an article page |
| 1 | `{elevation.1}` | Dropdown menus only |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` | Toasts |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` | Modals, which should be rare |

If a design here needs a shadow to separate two things, the correct fix is more whitespace or a hairline rule. A page of shadowed cards is a different direction entirely.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0 | Images, rules, inputs, tables |
| `{rounded.xs}` – `{rounded.md}` | 1–3px | Badges, small chips |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 4px | Cards and modals, the maximum |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Avatars only |

**Imagery is the hero.** Photographs run at `{rounded.none}` with no border and no shadow, at 3:2 or 16:9 for landscape and 4:5 for portrait. A full-bleed opening image that extends past the text column is the strongest move this system has. Captions sit directly beneath in `{typography.caption}`, `{colors.text-secondary}`, left-aligned to the image edge.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 80ms | Link underline draw |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 160ms | Button and input states |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 260ms | Menu open, tab change |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 420ms | Content fade on scroll into view |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 700ms | Opening image reveal, once per page |

**What animates:** opacity, and the underline on a link, which draws from the inline start. **What does not:** position, scale, or anything that makes text move while it is being read.

**Content fades in on scroll with no movement.** A 420ms opacity transition as a section enters the viewport is the entire scroll behavior. Sliding text is disorienting mid-read and this system is built for reading.

**Reduced motion:** all transitions become instant except the link underline, which remains as the only affordance cue.

## Components

### Buttons
`button-primary` is an oxblood fill with generous `{spacing.md} {spacing.xl}` padding at `{rounded.sm}`. `button-secondary` is an ink outline that inverts to an ink fill on hover. `button-ghost` is not a button shape at all: it is an underlined inline link in `{colors.accent}`, which is the correct treatment for most tertiary actions in an editorial context.

### Inputs & Forms
Inputs are **underlines, not boxes**: transparent background with a single bottom rule in `{colors.hairline-strong}`, which thickens to 2px `{colors.accent}` on focus. Labels sit above in `{typography.overline}`. This keeps forms consistent with the page's rule-based structure instead of importing app chrome.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is used sparingly, for indexes and related-article lists: white surface, hairline border, no shadow. `nav-bar` is a single row on the canvas with a bottom hairline, the wordmark at `{typography.heading-md}` in the display face, and navigation items in `{typography.body-sm}`. The active item is underlined in `{colors.accent}`.

### Data
`table-row` uses the body face at `{typography.body-sm}` with a bottom hairline and no vertical rules. Figures switch to `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`. Table headers are `{typography.overline}`. No zebra striping; hover shifts to `{colors.surface-sunken}`.

### Feedback
`badge` is a hairline-outlined rectangle in mono uppercase, used for categories and datelines rather than status. `toast` inverts to an ink fill with paper text, bottom-center. `modal` is a white surface at `{elevation.3}` over a `{colors.text-primary}` overlay at 40% opacity, unblurred.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Full asymmetric grid; marginalia column visible; images break wide |
| `lg` | 1024–1439px | Grid holds; marginalia narrows |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Marginalia moves inline below its anchor; images go full-width |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; display-xl drops 68 → 36px; nav collapses to a menu |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 68 → 36px, display-lg 46 → 30px, heading-lg 32 → 24px. Body drops from 17px to 16px and no further; line-height stays at 1.7 because a narrow measure needs the leading more, not less.

**Margins** shrink from 112px to 24px at `sm`, but the top and bottom section rhythm only drops from 112px to 64px. Vertical rhythm is the last thing to compress.

**Touch targets** reach 44px on links inside body copy by increasing the tapped area with padding, without introducing visible spacing between lines.

**RTL** uses logical properties throughout. The asymmetric grid mirrors: the marginalia column moves to the inline-end side automatically when the layout is expressed in `grid-column` with logical alignment. Drop caps and hanging punctuation need explicit review in RTL, since optical alignment is direction-specific.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Set the display tier large. 46px is the floor for Playfair.
- Cap the text measure near 68 characters and let the margin absorb the rest.
- Use whitespace and hairline rules to separate content, in place of cards.
- Reserve oxblood for links, section rules, and one primary action.
- Lead a page with a photograph or a headline, never with a colored panel.
- Set forms as underlined fields, matching the page's rule-based structure.

### Don't
- Don't center body text or headlines. Flush left, ragged right.
- Don't justify text; rivers ruin the texture at these measures.
- Don't use Playfair below 24px, where its hairlines disappear.
- Don't build a three-column grid of equal-weight cards. That is a different direction.
- Don't add shadows. If two things need separating, add space or a rule.
- Don't animate text position on scroll; fade only.
- Don't use a gradient as a hero. This system has images and type, and needs nothing else.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#fbf9f4` · Ink `#141210` / `#5a544c` · Oxblood `#7a2118` · Hairline `#e0d9cc` · Radius 4px maximum · Section rhythm 112px · Text measure 68ch · Playfair Display headlines, Source Serif 4 body, IBM Plex Mono overlines.

**Building an article page:**

> Build this page in the Editorial Print system. Warm paper `#fbf9f4`, ink `#141210`. Headline in Playfair Display 700 at 68px, line-height 1.02, tracking -1.6px, flush left. Standfirst in Source Serif 4 at 20px. Body at 17px, line-height 1.7, measure capped at 68 characters inside a 12-column grid using columns 1 to 7, with captions in columns 9 to 12. Section gaps of 112px with no rules except at major boundaries. Links in oxblood `#7a2118` with an underline that draws on hover. No cards, no shadows, no radius above 4px.

**Building a form:**

> Fields as underlines, not boxes: transparent background, 1px bottom border `#c4baa8`, thickening to 2px `#7a2118` on focus. Labels above in IBM Plex Mono 12px uppercase at 0.14em tracking. Errors inline below in `#a3271a`. Submit as an oxblood fill at 2px radius.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. The display-to-body jump is four-fold or the page reads as a template.
2. Whitespace and rules separate content. Cards and shadows do not.
3. Flush left, ragged right, measure capped at 68 characters.
