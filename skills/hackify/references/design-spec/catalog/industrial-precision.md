  An instrument, not a brochure. A narrow band of cool near-blacks carries every
  surface, separated by hairlines rather than shadows. One saturated amber signal
  appears at most twice per screen and always means act here. Numerics run
  monospaced with tabular figures so columns align down the page. Calm at rest,
  unmissable when something needs attention.

## Overview

This system behaves like a well-made tool. Nothing about it is trying to please you, and that is precisely why it earns trust. Surfaces sit within a narrow band of cool near-blacks, `{colors.canvas}` through `{colors.surface-raised}`, separated from each other by 1px hairlines rather than shadows. The result is a screen that stays flat and legible under fluorescent light, at 2am, on a laptop wedged into a rack aisle.

Attention is a budget, and amber is the currency. `{colors.accent}` appears at most twice on any screen and always carries the same meaning: act here, or look here. Everything else, including the semantic colors, stays desaturated so the accent never has competition. A screen with four amber elements has spent its budget four times over and directs attention nowhere.

Type does the hierarchy. `Archivo` sets headings tight and engineered, `Public Sans` carries body copy, and `JetBrains Mono` handles every number in the product. That last rule is not stylistic: numbers in a proportional face shift width as their digits change, so a column never quite aligns and a live-updating value jitters. Tabular figures fix both.

**Signature moves:**
- Tabular discipline: every figure is monospaced, right-aligned, and vertically aligned with the figure above it.
- Hairline separation: 1px borders carry structure; shadows appear only on modals and toasts.
- A single amber signal, budgeted at two appearances per screen.
- Uppercase mono overlines at 0.12em tracking labelling every section and metric.
- Radius capped at 8px on containers and 4px on controls, so nothing reads as soft.
- Motion as punctuation: 150ms state changes, one 240ms entry per view, no bounce anywhere.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Accent** (`{colors.accent}` — `#ffb020`): the only saturated color in the system. Primary buttons, active navigation, focus rings, the one metric that matters on a dashboard. Budget: two per screen.
- **Accent Hover** (`{colors.accent-hover}` — `#ffc14d`) and **Accent Press** (`{colors.accent-press}` — `#d98f0f`): the interactive pair. Never used for static content.
- **On Accent** (`{colors.on-accent}` — `#0b0d0e`): text and icons on any amber fill. Contrast 10.65:1.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#0b0d0e`): page background and nav chrome.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}` — `#141719`): cards, panels, modal bodies.
- **Surface Raised** (`{colors.surface-raised}` — `#1c2023`): toasts, badges, hover fills on dark rows.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}` — `#08090a`): inputs, code blocks, wells. Recessed, not raised.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#23282b`): the default 1px border. Does most of the structural work.
- **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#333a3e`): emphasized borders, modal edges, secondary button outlines.

### Text
- **Text Primary** (`{colors.text-primary}` — `#e8ebec`): body and headings. Contrast on canvas 16.26:1.
- **Text Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}` — `#9aa4a8`): labels, inactive navigation, supporting copy. Contrast 7.65:1.
- **Text Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — `#6b7579`): disabled states, timestamps, placeholder text. Non-essential information only.

### Semantic
- **Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#3fa66a`), **Caution** (`{colors.caution}` — `#c9962c`), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#d0503f`). Deliberately desaturated so they read as status rather than decoration, and so none of them competes with the amber accent. Caution is close to the accent in hue and must never appear on the same screen region as a primary action.

## Typography

### Font Family

`Archivo` is a tight grotesque with near-vertical terminals and a large x-height, which keeps headings compact without losing legibility at small sizes. `Public Sans` carries body copy: it is quieter than the display face, with open apertures that survive at 13px on a dim screen. `JetBrains Mono` handles numerics and code; its tall x-height matches Public Sans closely enough that mixed lines do not look assembled from two systems.

All three are freely licensed and installable today. The fallback stacks end in `sans-serif` and `monospace` respectively, so the preview renders without any network access.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 52px | 600 | 1.05 | -1.1px | Page hero, one per view |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 38px | 600 | 1.1 | -0.7px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 26px | 600 | 1.2 | -0.3px | Panel title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 20px | 600 | 1.3 | -0.2px | Card title |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 16px | 600 | 1.35 | 0 | Sub-section, form group |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 16px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 14px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Default body and UI text |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 13px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Dense panels, toasts |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 1.4 | 0 | Helper text, footnotes |
| `{typography.overline}` | 11px | 500 | 1.2 | 0.12em | Uppercase mono section labels |
| `{typography.button}` | 14px | 500 | 1 | 0 | All button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 13px | 450 | 1.45 | 0 | Every figure, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Every number is `{typography.numeric}`.** Currency, counts, durations, percentages, IDs, timestamps. No exceptions, including numbers inside sentences where a value updates live.
- **Right-align numerics, left-align text.** In tables this is what makes a column scannable; magnitude becomes visible as digit-column depth.
- **Overlines are mono, not sans.** The switch to `{fonts.mono}` at 11px with wide tracking is what makes a section label read as instrument chrome rather than a heading.
- **Weight jumps, not size creep.** Hierarchy below 26px is carried by weight and color, not by inventing a 22px step.
- **Measure caps at 76 characters** on body copy. Wider lines lose the reader between rows.

## Layout

**Base unit: 4px.** Every spacing value is a multiple. The scale runs 2 / 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 64, which covers control padding through page rhythm without intermediate improvisation.

**Container** maxes at 1280px for content-led pages. Dashboard and table surfaces run full-bleed with `{spacing.xl}` gutters, because horizontal space is information capacity and clipping it wastes it.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a `{spacing.xl}` gutter. Panels span named ranges. Asymmetric splits (8+4 for a main-with-sidebar, 7+5 for content-with-detail) read as considered; equal halves read as unresolved.

**Section rhythm:** `{spacing.huge}` between major sections on content pages, `{spacing.xxl}` between panels on dense surfaces, `{spacing.lg}` between rows within a panel. Whitespace is generous between groups and tight within them, so grouping is legible before anything is read.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is **the hairline**, not the shadow.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border | Cards, panels, table rows. The default. |
| 1 | `{elevation.1}` | Dropdowns, popovers, select menus. |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` | Toasts, floating action panels. |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` plus `{colors.hairline-strong}` border | Modals only. |

A card does not get a shadow. It gets a border and a surface value one step above the canvas. When a design needs a card to feel more prominent, the correct move is to raise its surface value or strengthen its border, never to add a shadow. Shadows in this system mean *this element floats above the plane and will be dismissed*, and using them decoratively destroys that meaning.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0 | Table cells, full-bleed panels, dividers |
| `{rounded.xs}` | 2px | Badges, tags, inline chips |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 4px | Buttons, inputs, selects, checkboxes |
| `{rounded.md}` | 6px | Dropdowns, popovers |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 8px | Cards, modals, panels |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 12px | Large feature containers only |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Status dots and progress tracks only, never buttons |

Radius is capped at 8px on containers and 4px on controls. Above that the system stops reading as engineered. Pill-shaped buttons are explicitly out of character here.

**Imagery** is rare and, when present, sits at `{rounded.sm}` with a 1px `{colors.hairline}` border. Avatars are `{rounded.sm}` squares, not circles. Icons are 1.5px stroke weight on a 20px grid, monochrome, inheriting the current text color.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 75ms | Hover fills, row highlights |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 150ms | Button states, focus rings, toggles |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 240ms | Panel and dropdown entry, tab switches |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 400ms | Modal entry, page transitions |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 600ms | Reserved for the single orchestrated page-load reveal |

**What animates:** opacity, and translation of no more than 4px. **What does not:** scale, rotation, color of large surfaces, anything on scroll.

**One orchestrated moment per view.** On first paint, hero elements fade in with a 4px rise, staggered at 40ms intervals, capped at eight elements. Every subsequent interaction uses `{motion.duration.fast}` or less. Scattering micro-interactions across a dense interface makes it feel unstable, which is the opposite of what this direction is for.

**Reduced motion:** honor `prefers-reduced-motion`. Opacity transitions remain; all translation is removed. The stagger becomes a single simultaneous fade.

## Components

### Buttons
`button-primary` is the amber fill and the only one of its kind on a screen. `button-secondary` is transparent with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` outline that shifts to `{colors.accent}` on hover, signalling interactivity without spending the accent budget. `button-ghost` carries `{colors.text-secondary}` with no border, for toolbar and tertiary actions. All three sit at `{rounded.sm}`, minimum 36px height on desktop and 44px on touch.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a sunken well: `{colors.surface-sunken}` behind a `{colors.hairline}` border, so fields read as recessed against the surface they sit on. Focus swaps the border to `{colors.hairline-strong}` and adds a 2px `{colors.focus-ring}` outline offset by 2px. Labels sit above at `{typography.caption}` in `{colors.text-secondary}`; errors appear inline below in `{colors.negative}`, never as a tooltip.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is `{colors.surface}` with a hairline border, `{rounded.lg}`, `{spacing.xl}` padding, no shadow. A single-metric card uses `{typography.display-lg}` for the figure under an `{typography.overline}` label. `nav-bar` sits on `{colors.canvas}` with one bottom hairline and no scroll shadow; the active item is `{colors.text-primary}` with a 2px `{colors.accent}` underline, and only one item is ever accented.

### Data
`table-row` carries `{typography.numeric}` with a bottom hairline and no zebra striping. Hover shifts the background to `{colors.surface}` rather than tinting it. Headers are `{typography.overline}` and stick on scroll. The sort caret in `{colors.accent}` is one of the two permitted accent appearances on a table view.

### Feedback
`badge` is a `{rounded.xs}` outlined chip in `{typography.overline}`; status variants swap border and text to the semantic color, keeping the fill transparent. `toast` sits at `{elevation.2}`, bottom-right on desktop and top on mobile, auto-dismissing at 6s. `modal` is the only level-3 surface, over an overlay of solid `{colors.canvas}` at 80% opacity. The overlay is not blurred: backdrop blur is a generic-AI signal and this system does not use it.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Full 12-column grid; sidebars persistent; tables show all columns |
| `lg` | 1024–1439px | Grid holds; secondary sidebar collapses to a toggle |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Two-column maximum; tables drop to priority columns with a detail drawer |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; nav becomes a bottom bar; display-xl drops 52 → 32px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 52 → 32px, display-lg 38 → 26px, heading-lg 26 → 20px. Body sizes do not shrink; below 13px this system stops being readable, and reading is the whole job.

**Touch targets** hit 44pt minimum on native and below the `md` breakpoint on web, by scaling control padding rather than shrinking type. **Tables** collapse to a priority-column view with a row-tap detail drawer; when horizontal scroll is genuinely needed, the table container scrolls, never the page.

**RTL** uses logical properties throughout (`margin-inline-start`, `padding-block-end`, `inset-inline-start`). No physical `left` or `right` appears in the stylesheet. Numeric spans carry `dir="ltr"` so figures stay LTR inside RTL runs.

**Native specifics:** light-content status bar on the dark canvas; shadow strings on iOS with matching Android `elevation` for z-ordering; haptics on primary and destructive actions only; Dynamic Type honored, with layouts reflowing rather than clipping.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Budget the accent at two appearances per screen and count them before shipping.
- Render every figure in `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`, right-aligned in tables.
- Separate surfaces with hairlines and surface-value steps, not shadows.
- Use `{typography.overline}` in mono for every section and metric label.
- Keep container radius at `{rounded.lg}` and control radius at `{rounded.sm}`.
- Reserve `{colors.negative}` for destructive actions and genuine failures.
- Test at 13px body on a dim screen before calling the density finished.

### Don't
- Don't add a shadow to a card. Raise its surface value or strengthen its border.
- Don't introduce a second saturated color. The accent's power comes from being alone.
- Don't use pill-shaped buttons or radii above 12px anywhere.
- Don't blur the modal overlay. Solid canvas at 80% opacity, always.
- Don't zebra-stripe tables. Hairlines and hover surface shifts carry the rows.
- Don't animate on scroll, and don't put hover effects on non-interactive elements.
- Don't let `{colors.caution}` sit near a primary action; at a glance it reads as the accent.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#0b0d0e` · Surface `#141719` · Hairline `#23282b` · Text `#e8ebec` / `#9aa4a8` · Accent `#ffb020` on `#0b0d0e` · Radius 4px controls / 8px containers · Base unit 4px · Archivo display, Public Sans body, JetBrains Mono numerics.

**Building a new screen:**

> Build this screen in the Industrial Precision system. Dark canvas `#0b0d0e`, panels on `#141719` separated by 1px `#23282b` hairlines with no shadows. Headings in Archivo 600 with tight negative tracking; body in Public Sans 14px; every number in JetBrains Mono with `font-feature-settings: "tnum"`, right-aligned. Exactly one amber `#ffb020` element for the primary action. Radius 4px on controls, 8px on containers. Transitions 150ms, no bounce, no scroll animation. Use CSS logical properties throughout.

**Building a data table:**

> Table with sticky `#23282b`-bordered header in uppercase JetBrains Mono 11px at 0.12em tracking. Rows separated by 1px hairlines, no zebra striping. All figures in JetBrains Mono 13px with `tnum`, right-aligned. Row hover shifts background to `#141719` with no color tint. Sort caret in `#ffb020` is the only accent on the view.

**Adding a component:** name its tokens before writing any CSS. If a value you need has no token, you are either missing a role or improvising, and improvising is how the system drifts.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. One amber signal, budgeted at two per screen.
2. Every number is monospaced and tabular.
3. Hairlines carry structure; shadows mean dismissible.
