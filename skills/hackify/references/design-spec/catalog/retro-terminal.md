description: >
  A console session in a dark room. Everything is monospaced, everything is fast,
  and the interface assumes competence instead of explaining itself. A blue-black
  field carries phosphor-green foreground text at three brightness levels, with
  amber reserved for anything that needs a decision and red for failure. Depth is
  dimming, not shadow. A live status line pinned to the bottom edge means the
  interface is never silent about what it is doing.

## Overview

Everything on this screen is text, and the text is doing all the work. `{colors.canvas}` is a blue-black that is deliberately not `#000`, because true black kills the sense that a phosphor is being excited by something. Foreground is `{colors.text-primary}`, a soft green that reads as illuminated rather than painted. There are no shadows, no radii, and no elevation levels: every value in `elevation` is `none` and every value in `rounded` is `0`, which is not laziness but the contract.

Hierarchy comes from **brightness**, not from color or from boxes. Active content sits at `{colors.text-primary}`, supporting content drops to `{colors.text-secondary}`, and inactive content drops again to `{colors.text-muted}`. Three levels, applied consistently, replace every card and divider a conventional system would need.

Color is a signal and never a surface. Amber `{colors.accent}` means a decision is required. Red `{colors.negative}` means something failed. Green above the standard foreground, `{colors.positive}`, means something succeeded. Nothing else is ever colored, and no color is ever used as a background fill larger than a button.

**Signature moves:**
- The live status line pinned to the bottom edge, showing state as `KEY: value` pairs, always.
- Three foreground brightness levels replacing all dividers and cards.
- Zero radius and zero shadow, throughout, with no exceptions.
- Monospaced everything, so columns align without any layout code.
- A blinking block cursor on the focused input, and a typewriter reveal on first paint only.
- Prompt-prefixed inputs, where the field is preceded by a `$` or `>` glyph rather than a label.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Amber** (`{colors.accent}`, `#ffb454`): decisions. Primary buttons, focused input borders, unsaved-state markers, confirmation prompts. Contrast against `{colors.on-accent}` is 11.13:1.
- **Amber Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}`, `{colors.accent-press}`): interactive states.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}`, `#0a0c0b`): the terminal field.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}`, `#101413`): panels and row hover, one step lighter.
- **Surface Raised** (`{colors.surface-raised}`, `#161b19`): toasts and inline popovers.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}`, `#060807`): input wells and output blocks.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}`, `#1e2622`) and **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}`, `#2e3a34`): box-drawing borders on panels and inputs.

### Text
- **Phosphor** (`{colors.text-primary}`, `#c8f2c0`): the standard foreground. Contrast on canvas 15.81:1.
- **Phosphor Dim** (`{colors.text-secondary}`, `#6f9e6a`): labels, chrome, inactive rows. Contrast 6.33:1.
- **Phosphor Faint** (`{colors.text-muted}`, `#4a6b47`): disabled, timestamps, decorative rules. Never carries information a user must read.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}`, `#6fe06a`) is a brighter green than the foreground, so success reads as intensity rather than hue change. **Caution** is the same value as `{colors.accent}` by design: in a terminal, a warning and a required decision are the same event. **Negative** (`{colors.negative}`, `#ff5f56`) is the only non-green, non-amber color in the system and appears only on failure.

## Typography

### Font Family

One family, `IBM Plex Mono`, at every size and role. This is the only spec in the catalog that does not pair a display face with a body face, because the monospace grid *is* the identity: the moment a proportional face appears, the alignment that makes this system work is gone.

Hierarchy is carried entirely by size, weight, and brightness. `IBM Plex Mono` is chosen over other monospaces for its distinct `0`, `1`, `l` and `I` shapes and its unusually complete weight range, which is what makes a single-family hierarchy possible.

The fallback stack ends in `monospace` and includes `ui-monospace`, `SF Mono`, `Menlo`, and `Consolas`, so the system renders correctly on a stock machine with no network access.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 44px | 700 | 1.1 | -0.5px | Splash or landing headline |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 32px | 700 | 1.15 | -0.3px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 22px | 600 | 1.25 | 0 | Panel title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 17px | 600 | 1.3 | 0 | Sub-panel title |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 14px | 600 | 1.35 | 0.02em | Uppercase group label |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 15px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 | Lead text |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 14px | 400 | 1.55 | 0 | Default body and output |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 13px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Dense panels, log lines |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 1.4 | 0 | Help text |
| `{typography.overline}` | 11px | 600 | 1.2 | 0.16em | Status-line keys, nav items |
| `{typography.button}` | 13px | 600 | 1 | 0.04em | Button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 13px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Line-height locks to the character grid.** Body at 14px with 1.55 line-height gives a 21.7px row; round it to 22px and use that as the vertical unit so text in adjacent columns aligns across panels.
- **Uppercase plus wide tracking marks chrome.** Anything that is interface rather than content is uppercase at 0.16em: status keys, nav items, column headers.
- **Weight, not color, marks emphasis** inside a line of output. Bold at the same brightness reads as emphasis; a color change reads as a status event, and confusing the two is the main way this system gets built wrong.
- **Never letter-space lowercase body text.** The monospace advance is already wide; adding tracking destroys word shapes.

## Layout

**Base unit: 4px** horizontally, **22px** vertically (the locked line box). Horizontal padding uses the 4px scale; vertical rhythm uses multiples of the line box, so everything sits on a shared baseline grid.

**Container** maxes at 1120px, roughly 80 columns at 14px, which is the width this aesthetic descends from. Wider content is allowed but the *text* column stays near 80 characters.

**Grid** is a character grid rather than a column grid. Panels are sized in character multiples, and box-drawing borders separate them. Splits at 1/3 and 2/3 read correctly because the character grid divides cleanly.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Tight. `{spacing.sm}` inside components, `{spacing.lg}` between them, `{spacing.huge}` at 48px between major regions. This direction is dense on purpose: generous padding makes it read as a themed web app rather than a console.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is **dimming**. Every elevation token is `none` and this is intentional.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat, `{colors.hairline-strong}` border | Every panel, card, modal, and toast |
| 1-3 | Not used | Layering is expressed by dimming what is behind |

When a modal opens, the content behind it drops from `{colors.text-primary}` to `{colors.text-muted}` and the modal keeps full brightness. That brightness differential is the entire z-axis. No overlay wash, no blur, no shadow.

Optional **very low-amplitude scanline texture** may sit over the canvas: a repeating 1px horizontal line at 2 to 3% opacity, at a 3px or 4px interval. It must never be strong enough to affect reading, and it must be removed entirely when `prefers-reduced-motion` or `prefers-contrast: more` is set.

## Shapes

Every radius token is `0`. There are no rounded corners anywhere in this system, including avatars, badges, buttons, inputs, and modals.

**Borders** are 1px and drawn in `{colors.hairline-strong}`. Where a decorative panel border is wanted, box-drawing characters may be used as literal text content, which keeps the border on the same character grid as everything else.

**Imagery** is rare. When present it renders at `{rounded.none}` with a 1px border. Avatars are square, initials-only, in `{typography.overline}` on `{colors.surface-raised}`. Icons should be avoided in favor of glyphs and short text markers such as `[!]`, `[ok]`, `>>`, since an icon set imports a visual language this system does not have.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 0ms | Most state changes: instant, no transition |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 75ms | Row hover, button state |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 120ms | Panel open |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 200ms | Modal open |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 600ms | Typewriter reveal on first paint only |

Easing is `steps(1, end)` for enter and exit, which means state changes snap rather than blend. That is the correct behavior: a terminal does not ease.

**The two permitted animations** are the blinking block cursor on the focused input (1s interval, hard on/off, no fade) and the typewriter reveal of the opening headline on first paint, capped at 600ms total.

**Reduced motion:** disable both. The cursor becomes a solid block and the headline appears immediately. Also drop the scanline texture.

## Components

### Buttons
`button-primary` is an amber fill with square corners and `{typography.button}` uppercase-ish labels at 0.04em tracking. `button-secondary` is a 1px `{colors.text-secondary}` outline that inverts to a solid phosphor fill with canvas-colored text on hover, which reads exactly like a selected line in a terminal UI. `button-ghost` is dim text with no border.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a sunken well with a 1px border that turns amber on focus, with a blinking block cursor. **Fields are prompt-prefixed**: a `$`, `>`, or `:` glyph in `{colors.text-secondary}` sits immediately before the field, replacing a conventional label where the field's purpose is obvious. Where a label is genuinely needed it sits above in `{typography.overline}`. Validation errors print below the field as `[!] message` in `{colors.negative}`.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is a bordered panel on `{colors.surface}`, square, with `{spacing.lg}` padding and an optional title bar in `{typography.heading-sm}`. `nav-bar` is a single row of `{typography.overline}` items separated by a dim `|` glyph, with the active item at full `{colors.text-primary}` brightness.

### Data
`table-row` has no borders at all: alignment is handled by the monospace grid, and separation by row hover shifting to `{colors.surface}`. Headers are `{typography.overline}` with a single `{colors.hairline-strong}` rule beneath. Figures use `tnum` and are right-aligned. This is the one place where the monospace family pays for itself completely.

### Feedback
`badge` is a bordered square chip in mono uppercase, typically holding a short status token such as `OK`, `WARN`, `FAIL`. `toast` is a bordered panel at the bottom-inline-end with no shadow and no animation beyond appearing. `modal` is a bordered panel; the background dims to `{colors.text-muted}` rather than being covered by an overlay.

### Signature: the status line
A single row pinned to the bottom edge of the viewport, on `{colors.surface}` with a top hairline, holding `{typography.overline}` `KEY: value` pairs separated by dim pipes. It shows connection state, current mode, counts, and the active context. It is never empty and never hidden, because a terminal that stops reporting its state is a terminal you cannot trust.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Multi-panel layout; status line shows all keys |
| `lg` | 1024-1439px | Panels reduce to two columns |
| `md` | 768-1023px | Single panel column; status line drops secondary keys |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; display-xl drops 44 → 26px; status line shows 2 keys |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 44 → 26px, display-lg 32 → 22px. Body stays at 14px and never shrinks; the whole aesthetic depends on the character grid staying legible.

**Tables scroll horizontally** inside their container rather than collapsing. Reflowing a monospaced table into stacked cards destroys the alignment that is the reason to use this direction at all.

**Touch targets** reach 44px by increasing vertical padding on rows and buttons, which stretches the character grid vertically but keeps the horizontal advance intact.

**RTL** needs care. Monospace alignment is inherently direction-sensitive, and box-drawing glyphs do not mirror. Use logical properties for layout, keep tabular data and any box-drawn panel in an LTR run with `dir="ltr"`, and set prose in the document direction. Do not attempt to mirror the status line's `KEY: value` pairs.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Keep every radius at 0 and every shadow at none.
- Use three foreground brightness levels instead of dividers, cards, and shadows.
- Pin a live status line to the bottom edge showing real state.
- Prompt-prefix inputs with `$` or `>` instead of adding a label above every field.
- Reserve amber for decisions, red for failures, bright green for success.
- Right-align figures with `tnum` and let the monospace grid do the table layout.

### Don't
- Don't add CRT curvature, heavy glow, or strong scanlines. That is costume, not craft.
- Don't introduce a proportional typeface anywhere, including navigation.
- Don't use a rainbow of colors. Green, amber, red, and nothing else.
- Don't round a corner or add a shadow, ever.
- Don't use an icon set. Use glyphs and short text markers.
- Don't add generous padding to make it feel modern; density is the point.
- Don't animate anything beyond the cursor blink and the first-paint reveal.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#0a0c0b` · Phosphor `#c8f2c0` / `#6f9e6a` / `#4a6b47` · Amber `#ffb454` · Fail `#ff5f56` · Radius 0 · Shadow none · IBM Plex Mono everywhere · Line box 22px.

**Building a console screen:**

> Build this in the Retro Terminal system. Blue-black canvas `#0a0c0b`, IBM Plex Mono at every size, phosphor green `#c8f2c0` foreground with `#6f9e6a` for chrome and `#4a6b47` for disabled. Zero border-radius and zero box-shadow anywhere. Panels are 1px `#2e3a34` borders. Amber `#ffb454` only on the primary action and focused input border. Pin a bottom status line showing `KEY: value` pairs in 11px uppercase at 0.16em tracking. Transitions use `steps(1, end)`, mostly instant. Lock line-height to a 22px grid.

**Building a data view:**

> Table with no cell borders: monospace alignment carries the columns. Header row in 11px uppercase 0.16em tracking with one `#2e3a34` rule beneath. Figures right-aligned with `font-feature-settings: "tnum"`. Row hover shifts background to `#101413`, no color tint. Status column uses bordered square chips reading `OK`, `WARN`, `FAIL` in the semantic colors.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Zero radius, zero shadow, one monospaced family.
2. Brightness is the hierarchy; color is only ever a signal.
3. The status line always reports real state.
