  The structure is the design. Paper white and true black do almost everything,
  with one electric blue used in large flat areas rather than small details.
  Zero radius, zero shadow, 3px black borders, and hard offset blocks for depth.
  Display type is set large enough to become the layout. Motion is abrupt because
  softening a state change would be a kind of apology, and this system does not apologize.

## Overview

This system does not try to be liked. `{colors.canvas}` is a slightly off paper white, `{colors.text-primary}` is a true near-black, and the border between any two things is 3px of that black. Nothing is rounded, nothing is blurred, and nothing fades. Every construction detail is visible on purpose: where a conventional system hides its structure behind soft edges and shadows, this one shows the seams and treats them as the ornament.

Depth is a **hard offset block**. `{elevation.1}` is `4px 4px 0 0` of solid black with no blur, so an element appears to sit on the page like a printed layer rather than to float above it. Pressing a button removes the offset entirely and the element drops flat, which is the most satisfying interaction this system has and costs nothing.

The one color, `{colors.accent}` electric blue, is used in **large flat areas**: a full-bleed section, a filled button, an entire hovered table row. It is never a small detail, never a tint, and never part of a gradient. Applying it sparingly to little accents would produce a polite web page with a blue link, which is precisely what this direction rejects.

**Signature moves:**
- Type set so large it becomes the layout: `{typography.display-xl}` at 128px with 0.88 line-height and -4px tracking.
- 3px solid black borders on every container and control.
- Hard offset shadows with zero blur, which collapse to flat on press.
- Zero radius everywhere, including avatars.
- The full-row color invert on hover, rather than a subtle tint.
- Uppercase mono for all chrome, captions, and labels.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Electric Blue** (`{colors.accent}`, `#1f4fe0`): filled buttons, full-bleed sections, hovered table rows, focus rings. Contrast against white is 6.46:1. Used in large areas only.
- **Blue Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}`, `#1a44c4`, `{colors.accent-press}`, `#15379e`).

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}`, `#f4f4f0`): the page, slightly off-white so pure-white cards read as laid on top.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}`, `#ffffff`): cards, inputs, modals.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}`, `#e8e8e2`): disabled fills and quiet blocks.
- **Hairline** and **Hairline Strong** (both `#0a0a0a`): identical by design. There is only one border color in this system, and it is black.

### Text
- **Black** (`{colors.text-primary}`, `#0a0a0a`): everything. Contrast on canvas 17.96:1.
- **Grey** (`{colors.text-secondary}`, `#4a4a4a`): captions, secondary labels. Contrast 8.04:1.
- **Grey Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}`, `#767670`): disabled only.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}`, `#0d7a3d`), **Caution** (`{colors.caution}`, `#8a6a00`), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}`, `#c81e0e`). All fully saturated flat colors, used as fills with black borders in the same way as the accent. No tints, no soft backgrounds, no 10%-opacity alert boxes.

## Typography

### Font Family

`Syne` is a display face with unusual, almost architectural forms that get stranger as the weight increases. At 800 it stops reading as a normal grotesque and starts reading as a constructed object, which is exactly what a headline needs to do here. It is only used at 26px and above.

`Chivo` carries body copy. It is a sturdy grotesque with high legibility and enough weight range to hold up beside Syne without disappearing. `DM Mono` handles captions, overlines, and figures, and its appearance is a deliberate signal that a piece of text is metadata rather than content.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 128px | 800 | 0.88 | -4px | The headline that is the layout |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 72px | 800 | 0.92 | -2.4px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 40px | 700 | 1 | -1px | Block title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 26px | 700 | 1.1 | -0.4px | Card title |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 18px | 700 | 1.25 | 0 | Uppercase group label (body face) |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.4 | 0 | Dense text |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13px | 400 | 1.35 | 0 | Mono captions and metadata |
| `{typography.overline}` | 12px | 500 | 1.2 | 0.08em | Mono uppercase chrome |
| `{typography.button}` | 16px | 700 | 1 | 0.02em | Uppercase button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 15px | 400 | 1.4 | 0 | Figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Display type fills its container.** `{typography.display-xl}` should be sized so the headline spans the full column edge to edge, which usually means clamping between 64px and 128px with a viewport-relative middle value rather than fixing one size.
- **Line-height below 1 on display.** 0.88 makes multi-line headlines stack into a solid block of type, which is the intended texture.
- **Extreme scale contrast.** The jump from display to body is eight-fold. A timid 2x jump produces a normal website.
- **Mono marks metadata.** Anything that describes content rather than being content is `DM Mono`, uppercase where short.
- **Never letterspace lowercase Chivo.** The body face is set plain; all the typographic personality lives in the display tier.

## Layout

**Base unit: 8px**, with a coarse scale: 8 / 16 / 24 / 40 / 64 / 120. Fine values below 8px exist only for border-adjacent nudges.

**Container** runs to 1440px, and full-bleed sections that ignore the container entirely are common and encouraged. A section of solid `{colors.accent}` spanning the full viewport width, with content inset, is a core move.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a 24px gutter, rigorously honored. This matters more than it might seem: real brutalism is strictly gridded, and the "chaotic" look comes from *deliberate* violations of a visible grid, not from the absence of one. Elements overlap by spanning intersecting column ranges, which reads as constructed rather than accidental.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Large blocks of space alternating with dense blocks of content. `{spacing.huge}` at 120px between major sections, then content packed tightly inside them. Even distribution of space would flatten the rhythm this direction depends on.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is the **hard offset block**: a solid shadow with zero blur, in the text color.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat, 3px border | Pressed states, inline elements |
| 1 | `4px 4px 0 0` solid black | Buttons at rest |
| 2 | `8px 8px 0 0` solid black | Cards |
| 3 | `12px 12px 0 0` solid black | Modals |

The offset always runs down and toward the inline end, so the implied light source is consistent. On press, the element translates by the offset amount and the shadow goes to `{elevation.0}`, so it appears to be pushed flat against the page. That single interaction is worth more than any amount of hover animation.

**No blur is permitted on any shadow.** A blurred shadow in this system reads as a mistake from a different design language.

## Shapes

Every radius token is `0`. Buttons, inputs, cards, modals, badges, and avatars are all square. This is absolute.

**Borders** are 3px on containers and controls, 1px only inside table rows where a 3px rule would overwhelm the data. There is one border color, `{colors.text-primary}`.

**Imagery** runs at `{rounded.none}` with a 3px black border, often in high-contrast black and white or duotone using the accent. Images are cropped hard, frequently to unusual aspect ratios, and may overlap adjacent blocks. Avatars are square with a 3px border. Icons should be avoided in favor of typographic markers, arrows (`->`, `<-`), and geometric shapes drawn as borders.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` / `{motion.duration.fast}` | 0ms | Hover, focus, and color changes: instant |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 90ms | Press translation and shadow collapse |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 140ms | Modal appearance |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 300ms | Single page-load reveal, optional |

Easing is `linear`, and `move` uses `steps(2, end)` so anything that does travel arrives in visible increments rather than gliding. Softening these transitions makes the system feel like a normal web app with square corners, which misses the point entirely.

**The only meaningful animation is the press:** translate by the shadow offset and remove the shadow in 90ms. Everything else changes instantly.

**Reduced motion:** remove the optional page-load reveal. All other states are already instant.

## Components

### Buttons
All buttons are square with 3px black borders and an offset shadow. `button-primary` is an electric blue fill with white text. `button-secondary` is white and inverts to a solid black fill with canvas text on hover. `button-ghost` is a 3px bottom border only, with no fill. Labels are uppercase in `{typography.button}`.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a white box with a 3px black border and generous `{spacing.md}` padding. Focus adds a 4px solid blue ring with no offset and no fade. Labels sit above in `{typography.heading-sm}` uppercase. Errors appear below in `{colors.negative}` inside a bordered block, not as floating text.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is a white box with a 3px border and an 8px offset shadow. Cards may deliberately overlap by a few pixels where the grid brings them together; that overlap is a feature. `nav-bar` is a row with a 3px bottom border, wordmark in `{typography.heading-md}`, and items in mono uppercase. The active item gets a solid `{colors.text-primary}` fill with canvas text.

### Data
`table-row` uses 1px black bottom rules and `{typography.numeric}`. Hover **inverts the entire row** to an electric blue fill with white text, which is the correct amount of subtlety for this system. Headers are mono uppercase with a 3px bottom rule.

### Feedback
`badge` is a solid black block with canvas text in mono uppercase; semantic variants swap the fill to the flat semantic color. `toast` is a solid black block at the bottom-inline-start with no shadow. `modal` is a white box with a 3px border and a 12px offset shadow, over a `{colors.text-primary}` overlay at 60% opacity, unblurred.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | display-xl at full 128px; overlapping blocks active |
| `lg` | 1024-1439px | display-xl clamps to ~96px; overlaps reduce |
| `md` | 768-1023px | Two-column maximum; offsets drop from 8px to 6px |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; display-xl to 48px; offsets drop to 4px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 128 → 48px, display-lg 72 → 36px, heading-lg 40 → 28px. The tracking scales with it, from -4px to -1.5px, since heavy negative tracking at small sizes collides letterforms.

**Borders stay 3px** at every breakpoint. Reducing them to 1px on mobile is the fastest way to lose the identity.

**Shadow offsets scale down** from 8px to 4px so cards do not consume the narrow viewport.

**Accessibility note.** Brutalism is not an excuse for poor contrast or missing focus states. The 4px focus ring is deliberately the most visible focus indicator in this catalog. Every interactive element has a non-color state change, and the hover row invert also changes text color, so it does not rely on hue alone.

**RTL** uses logical properties, and the shadow offset mirrors to the inline-end side so the implied light source stays consistent with the reading direction.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Set the display tier large enough to become the layout.
- Use 3px black borders on every container and control.
- Use hard offset shadows with zero blur, collapsing to flat on press.
- Apply the accent in large flat areas: full sections, filled buttons, whole rows.
- Honor a strict 12-column grid, and break it deliberately rather than randomly.
- Keep the focus ring at 4px and highly visible.

### Don't
- Don't round any corner, anywhere, including avatars.
- Don't blur a shadow. Zero blur or no shadow.
- Don't use the accent as a small detail or an inline tint.
- Don't ease transitions into softness; instant or stepped.
- Don't apply random rotation to elements. The grid is the discipline.
- Don't confuse brutalism with poor accessibility. Contrast and focus states are non-negotiable.
- Don't reduce border width on mobile to save space.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#f4f4f0` · Surface `#ffffff` · Black `#0a0a0a` · Blue `#1f4fe0` · Border 3px black · Radius 0 · Shadow `Npx Npx 0 0` black, zero blur · Syne 800 display, Chivo body, DM Mono metadata.

**Building a page:**

> Build this in the Brutalist Mono system. Off-white canvas `#f4f4f0`, white blocks with 3px `#0a0a0a` borders and hard offset shadows `8px 8px 0 0 #0a0a0a` with zero blur. Headline in Syne 800, clamped between 48px and 128px so it spans the column edge to edge, line-height 0.88, tracking -4px. Body in Chivo 16px. Captions and labels in DM Mono uppercase. Zero border-radius anywhere. One full-bleed section in electric blue `#1f4fe0`. All transitions instant except the press, which translates 8px and removes the shadow in 90ms. Strict 12-column grid with deliberate overlaps.

**Building a table:**

> 1px black bottom rules, DM Mono figures with `tnum`, header row in mono uppercase with a 3px bottom rule. Row hover inverts the whole row to `#1f4fe0` with white text. No zebra striping, no radius, no shadow.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Zero radius, 3px black borders, zero-blur offset shadows.
2. The display tier is the layout, not a label on it.
3. The accent fills large areas, never small details.
