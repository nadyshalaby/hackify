description: >
  Maximum information per square inch without becoming unreadable. A deep neutral
  field with three surface values, small type on tight rows, and color reserved
  almost entirely for encoding data rather than decorating chrome. Panels are
  separated by hairlines rather than gaps, sticky headers replace elevation, and
  every figure is monospaced and right-aligned so magnitude is visible as column depth.

## Overview

This system is built for someone whose job is to compare many things at once. Type runs 12 to 13px, rows are tight, panels butt against each other with a hairline between them rather than a gap, and there is no container max-width because horizontal space is information capacity. Every pixel spent on padding is a row the user cannot see.

The governing rule is that **color belongs to the data, not to the chrome**. Navigation, panel headers, borders, and labels are all achromatic: `{colors.text-secondary}` and `{colors.hairline}` and nothing else. Color appears when a value is positive or negative, when a series needs distinguishing in a chart, or when a row is selected. The moment chrome takes a color, the data stops being the only colored thing on screen and scanning gets slower.

Density is not an excuse for illegibility. `IBM Plex Sans` was drawn for small sizes and holds its shape at 12px, the row height stays at a comfortable 28px despite the tight padding, and contrast stays well above AA. Density that costs readability is just crowding.

**Signature moves:**
- The comparison-ready table: monospaced right-aligned figures, in-cell magnitude bars, sticky header, no zebra striping.
- Achromatic chrome, so color only ever encodes data.
- Panels separated by hairlines with zero gap between them.
- 10px uppercase labels at 0.09em tracking for every column and metric.
- Full-bleed layout with no container max-width.
- A 75ms flash on any value that just changed.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Blue** (`{colors.accent}` — `#4a9eda`): selection, focus, active tab, primary button, sort indicator. Contrast against `{colors.on-accent}` is 6.84:1. This is the only accent, and it means *selected or actionable*, never *important*.
- **Blue Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}` — `#6bb2e4`, `{colors.accent-press}` — `#3580b5`).

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#0d1013`): the outermost field and the gutter between panel groups.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}` — `#141a1f`): panels, cards, nav.
- **Surface Raised** (`{colors.surface-raised}` — `#1b2229`): row hover, secondary buttons, toasts.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}` — `#090c0f`): inputs, code and log wells.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#1f272e`): row rules inside a table.
- **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#2d3841`): panel edges, header rules, input borders.

### Text
- **Primary** (`{colors.text-primary}` — `#dfe5e9`): values and headings. Contrast on canvas 15.01:1.
- **Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}` — `#8b97a1`): labels, column headers, chrome. Contrast 6.40:1.
- **Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — `#61707c`): disabled, null values, units.

### Semantic (data encoding)
- **Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#3fb27a`) and **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#e05c4e`): value direction. Applied to the figure itself, not to a background.
- **Caution** (`{colors.caution}` — `#d9a441`): threshold breaches and stale data.

**Categorical series** for charts, in order: `{colors.accent}`, `{colors.positive}`, `{colors.caution}`, `{colors.negative}`, then `#9b7fd4` and `#54c2c2`. Six is the maximum; beyond that a chart needs grouping, not more colors.

## Typography

### Font Family

`IBM Plex Sans` and `IBM Plex Mono` are the same design family, which is why this pairing works better than most sans-plus-mono combinations. They share proportions, x-height, and terminal treatment, so a table with sans labels and mono figures reads as one system rather than two pasted together.

Plex Sans was drawn with small sizes in mind: open apertures, unambiguous `1`, `l` and `I`, and a large x-height relative to cap height. At 12px it stays legible where most grotesques begin to close up. Plex Mono carries genuinely tabular figures with a slashed zero, which matters when a column contains both `0` and `O`.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 32px | 600 | 1.15 | -0.6px | The single headline metric |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 24px | 600 | 1.2 | -0.4px | Panel headline figure |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 18px | 600 | 1.25 | -0.2px | Page title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 15px | 600 | 1.3 | 0 | Panel title |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 13px | 600 | 1.3 | 0 | Sub-panel title |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 14px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Descriptive prose, rare here |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 13px | 400 | 1.4 | 0 | Default UI text |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 12px | 400 | 1.35 | 0 | Dense labels |
| `{typography.caption}` | 11px | 400 | 1.3 | 0 | Units, footnotes |
| `{typography.overline}` | 10px | 600 | 1.2 | 0.09em | Column headers, metric labels |
| `{typography.button}` | 12px | 600 | 1 | 0.01em | Button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 12px | 450 | 1.35 | -0.01em | Every figure, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Display sizes are small.** The largest text in this system is 32px, which is a body size in most others. A dashboard does not need a hero.
- **Every figure is `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`,** right-aligned. This is non-negotiable and is the reason the direction works.
- **Units are `{typography.caption}` in `{colors.text-muted}`,** set beside the figure rather than inside it, so the number itself stays scannable.
- **Column headers are 10px uppercase at 0.09em.** Small enough to stay out of the way, tracked enough to stay readable.
- **Never go below 11px** for anything a user must read. Density has a floor.

## Layout

**Base unit: 2px.** The scale is deliberately fine: 1 / 2 / 4 / 6 / 10 / 16 / 24 / 40. Padding decisions matter at 2px resolution when rows are 28px tall.

**No container max-width.** Layout is full-bleed. On a 3440px display the user gets more columns, which is the point of owning a wide monitor.

**Panels butt together.** The canonical layout is a grid of panels separated by a single `{colors.hairline-strong}` line with no gap. Gaps between panels waste vertical space across a dozen boundaries, and the hairline reads as a cleaner separation anyway.

**Row height is 28px** at `{typography.numeric}` 12px with `{spacing.sm}` vertical padding. This is the tightest comfortable value; below 26px scanning accuracy drops noticeably.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Spend it inside groups, not between them. `{spacing.lg}` of horizontal cell padding keeps columns readable, while `{spacing.xxs}` between stacked panels keeps the screen full. The instinct to add breathing room is correct in most systems and wrong in this one.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is the **hairline and the sticky element**. Panels do not float.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat, hairline border | Every panel, card, table |
| 1 | `{elevation.1}` | Sticky headers once scrolled, frozen columns |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` | Dropdowns, toasts, context menus |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` | Modals |

The one place shadow earns its place is the **sticky header and frozen column**: when content scrolls beneath them, a `{elevation.1}` shadow appears to signal the overlap. At rest they carry no shadow. That transition is a functional cue, not decoration.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0 | Table cells, panel edges, chart areas |
| `{rounded.xs}` | 1px | Badges, tags |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 2px | Buttons, inputs, selects |
| `{rounded.md}` – `{rounded.lg}` | 3–4px | Dropdowns, modals |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Status dots only |

Radius stays tiny. At this density a 6px radius on a 28px row eats visible area and makes adjacent panels look detached.

**Charts** follow the same discipline: 1px axis lines in `{colors.hairline-strong}`, gridlines in `{colors.hairline}` and only on the value axis, no chart border, no drop shadow, no gradient fill. Series use the categorical order above. Data labels are `{typography.numeric}`. Sparklines run 16px tall inline in table cells.

**Icons** are 1.5px stroke on a 16px grid, in `{colors.text-secondary}`, used only where a word would be longer.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 40ms | Row hover |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 75ms | Button states, value-change flash |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 120ms | Dropdown open, panel resize |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 180ms | Modal entry |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 240ms | The longest duration permitted |

**Sorting and filtering apply instantly.** Animating a re-sort makes the user wait to read the answer they just asked for. Rows reorder with no transition.

**The one signature animation is the value-change flash:** when a figure updates, its cell background flashes to a 12% tint of `{colors.positive}` or `{colors.negative}` for 75ms and fades over 240ms. In a live-updating view this is how a user notices what moved without watching everything.

**Reduced motion:** drop the flash entirely and mark changed values with a small directional glyph instead. All other transitions are already at or near instant.

## Components

### Buttons
Compact: `{typography.button}` at 12px with `{spacing.md} {spacing.lg}` padding, 24px tall. `button-primary` is a blue fill, used for the one committing action in a toolbar. `button-secondary` is `{colors.surface-raised}` with a hairline border and is the default for most toolbar actions. `button-ghost` is bare text for tertiary actions and icon buttons.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a sunken well with a hairline border, 26px tall. Filter and search inputs sit inline in panel headers rather than in a separate filter bar, which saves a full row of vertical space. Labels are usually omitted in favor of placeholder plus an `{typography.overline}` group header, since dense tools are used repeatedly by people who already know the fields.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is a panel: `{colors.surface}` with a hairline border and `{spacing.lg}` padding. A metric card shows an `{typography.overline}` label, a `{typography.display-lg}` figure, and a `{typography.caption}` delta in the semantic color. `nav-bar` is a 36px row on `{colors.surface}` with a bottom hairline; the active item carries a 2px blue bottom border.

### Data
This is the system's centre.

- **Header row:** `{typography.overline}`, sticky, with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` bottom rule and a `{elevation.1}` shadow once scrolled.
- **Rows:** 28px tall, `{typography.numeric}`, `{colors.hairline}` bottom rules, no zebra striping.
- **Figures:** right-aligned with `tnum`. Negative values in `{colors.negative}` with a leading minus, never parentheses.
- **Magnitude:** an optional in-cell horizontal bar at 10% accent opacity behind the figure, scaled to the column maximum, so relative size is visible without reading.
- **Hover:** background shifts to `{colors.surface-raised}`, no color tint.
- **Selection:** a 2px `{colors.accent}` inline-start border plus a 10% accent background.
- **Frozen first column** with a `{elevation.1}` shadow when scrolled horizontally.

### Feedback
`badge` is a 1px outlined chip in `{typography.overline}`; status variants take the semantic border and text color with no fill. `toast` sits bottom-inline-end on `{colors.surface-raised}`. `modal` is `{rounded.lg}` at `{elevation.3}` over `{colors.canvas}` at 72% opacity, unblurred.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | All columns visible; side panels persistent; charts full detail |
| `lg` | 1024–1439px | Side panel collapses to icons; low-priority columns hidden |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Single panel column; table scrolls horizontally with a frozen key column |
| `sm` | < 768px | Table becomes a stacked list of key-value pairs |

**Column priority is declared per column,** not inferred. Every table column carries a priority so hiding is deterministic across breakpoints. Hiding the wrong column silently is worse than a horizontal scrollbar.

**Horizontal scroll is acceptable and often correct.** The table container scrolls, never the page, and the key column stays frozen.

**At `sm` the table stops being a table.** A stacked key-value list per record is more usable than a two-column squeeze, and figures keep `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`.

**Type does not shrink below 11px** at any breakpoint. Density is achieved by hiding columns, not by shrinking type.

**Touch targets:** below `md`, row height increases from 28px to 44px. Density is a desktop affordance; a touch user gets a different, less dense arrangement rather than a smaller one.

**RTL** uses logical properties. Numeric columns stay LTR with `dir="ltr"` on the cell so figures and minus signs read correctly, while labels follow the document direction.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Keep chrome achromatic so color only ever encodes data.
- Right-align every figure in `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`.
- Separate panels with a hairline and no gap.
- Declare a priority for every table column.
- Use in-cell magnitude bars to make relative size visible without reading.
- Flash changed values for 75ms in a live view.
- Keep row height at 28px on desktop and raise it to 44px on touch.

### Don't
- Don't add generous padding. It destroys the density that justifies this direction.
- Don't use card grids where a table belongs.
- Don't color the navigation, panel headers, or borders.
- Don't animate sorting or filtering.
- Don't zebra-stripe. Hairlines and hover carry the rows.
- Don't exceed six categorical colors in a chart.
- Don't shrink type below 11px to fit more columns; hide columns instead.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#0d1013` · Surface `#141a1f` · Hairline `#1f272e` / `#2d3841` · Text `#dfe5e9` / `#8b97a1` · Blue `#4a9eda` · Row 28px · Radius 2px · IBM Plex Sans chrome, IBM Plex Mono figures.

**Building a dashboard:**

> Build this in the Data Dense system. Deep neutral canvas `#0d1013`, panels on `#141a1f` butting together with 1px `#2d3841` separators and no gaps. No container max-width; use the full viewport. IBM Plex Sans for chrome, IBM Plex Mono with `font-feature-settings: "tnum"` for every figure, right-aligned. Column headers 10px uppercase at 0.09em in `#8b97a1`. Chrome is entirely achromatic; color only on values (`#3fb27a` positive, `#e05c4e` negative) and selection (`#4a9eda`). Row height 28px. Radius 2px. Sorting applies instantly with no animation.

**Building a table:**

> Sticky header with a `#2d3841` bottom rule that gains a subtle shadow once scrolled. 28px rows with 1px `#1f272e` rules, no zebra striping. Figures right-aligned in IBM Plex Mono 12px with `tnum`; negatives in `#e05c4e` with a leading minus. Optional 10%-opacity accent bar behind each figure scaled to the column maximum. Row hover shifts background to `#1b2229` with no tint. Selected rows get a 2px `#4a9eda` inline-start border. Freeze the first column with a shadow on horizontal scroll.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Color encodes data; chrome stays achromatic.
2. Every figure is monospaced, tabular, and right-aligned.
3. Padding is the enemy; hairlines separate, gaps do not.
