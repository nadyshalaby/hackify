  The International Typographic Style applied honestly rather than quoted. White
  field, black text, one red accent, and a single typeface at three weights. All
  hierarchy comes from size, weight and position; there are no shadows, no radii
  worth mentioning, and no decoration. A visible twelve-column grid with asymmetric
  spans does the composing, and every element sits where the grid says it sits.

## Overview

This system has five colors and one typeface. `{colors.canvas}` is pure white, `{colors.text-primary}` is a near-black, two greys carry secondary and disabled text, and `{colors.accent}` red marks the one thing that matters on a view. Everything else is achieved by size, weight, and position on a grid.

The grid is not a helper, it is the design. Twelve columns, a 36px gutter, and a discipline that every element spans a named range. What separates this from a generic white website is that the spans are **asymmetric**: 5+7, 4+8, 3+9. Equal halves are what a layout does when nobody decided anything, and deciding is the entire method here.

There is nothing to hide behind. No shadow, no gradient, no radius beyond 2px, no illustration style, no decorative icon. When a page in this system looks wrong, the fault is in the typography or the alignment, and the fix is in the typography or the alignment. That accountability is why the style has survived for seventy years.

**Signature moves:**
- A visible twelve-column grid with asymmetric spans, never lazy halves.
- One typeface at three weights carrying the whole hierarchy.
- Flush left, ragged right, with an aligned baseline grid across columns.
- Red used as a flat marker: a filled button, a rule, a badge. Never a wash.
- Black 1px rules as the only separator in the system.
- Zero shadows on anything except modals and toasts.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Red** (`{colors.accent}`, `#d42b1e`): the primary button, an emphasis rule, a badge, the focus ring. Contrast against white is 5.04:1. One red element per view is the target; two is the maximum.
- **Red Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}`, `#b8241a`, `{colors.accent-press}`, `#931c14`).

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}`, `#ffffff`): the page, and also cards, and also modals. There is essentially one surface in this system.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}`, `#f2f2f2`): row hover and disabled fills, the only tonal variation permitted.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}`, `#d8d8d8`): light rules inside dense content such as tables.
- **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}`, `#0d0d0d`): black rules. The primary structural device, used under the nav bar, above footers, and to mark section boundaries.

### Text
- **Black** (`{colors.text-primary}`, `#0d0d0d`): everything. Contrast 19.44:1.
- **Grey** (`{colors.text-secondary}`, `#5c5c5c`): captions, secondary information. Contrast 6.69:1.
- **Grey Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}`, `#8c8c8c`): disabled only.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}`, `#157a45`) and **Caution** (`{colors.caution}`, `#8a6100`). **Negative** is deliberately the same value as `{colors.accent}`: in a system with one accent, an error and an emphasis are the same red, distinguished by context and by an accompanying label. Semantic colors are flat fills or text colors, never tinted background panels.

## Typography

### Font Family

One family everywhere: `Instrument Sans`, at 400 for body, 700 for display and emphasis, and nothing else. Restricting to two weights of one family is not a limitation to work around; it is what forces hierarchy to be expressed through size and space, which is the method.

`Instrument Sans` is a contemporary neo-grotesque with tight spacing, a large x-height, and unusually clean numerals. It sits in the Helvetica lineage without being a revival, which is the right relationship to have with this style: applied honestly rather than quoted.

`Anonymous Pro` handles tabular figures only. Its appearance in a table is the single exception to the one-family rule, justified because proportional figures do not align in columns.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 80px | 700 | 0.95 | -2.4px | Page headline |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 52px | 700 | 1 | -1.4px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 32px | 700 | 1.1 | -0.6px | Block title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 21px | 700 | 1.2 | -0.2px | Sub-block title |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 16px | 700 | 1.3 | 0 | Group label |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 15px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 13px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 | Captions, table cells |
| `{typography.caption}` | 12px | 400 | 1.4 | 0 | Fine print |
| `{typography.overline}` | 11px | 700 | 1.2 | 0.08em | Uppercase section label |
| `{typography.button}` | 15px | 700 | 1 | 0 | Button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 14px | 400 | 1.45 | 0 | Figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Two weights only.** 400 and 700. A 500 or 600 weight creeping in is the first sign the hierarchy is being solved with tone instead of structure.
- **Flush left, ragged right.** Never justified, never centered, including headlines and buttons labels.
- **Line-height 1.5 across body sizes,** so text in adjacent columns shares a baseline. That shared baseline across a multi-column layout is a defining detail of the style.
- **Negative tracking scales with size.** -2.4px at 80px down to 0 at 16px. Large type set at default tracking looks loose and undesigned.
- **Set headlines in sentence case.** Uppercase headlines belong to a different tradition.

## Layout

**Base unit: 12px** with a 4px sub-grid for fine adjustments. The scale runs 4 / 8 / 12 / 24 / 36 / 60 / 96, all multiples of the base or its half.

**Container** maxes at 1280px with a 36px outer margin, matching the gutter so the grid reads continuously to the edge.

**Grid** is 12 columns, 36px gutter, rigorously honored. This is the core of the system:

- Content spans named ranges: 1-5, 6-12, 1-8, 4-12.
- Asymmetric splits are the default: 5+7 for text with a supporting image, 4+8 for a sidebar with content, 3+9 for a label column with a body column.
- A **baseline grid** of 24px runs vertically. Text in every column sits on it, so adjacent columns align across a horizontal read.
- Elements may span the full width, but never sit outside the grid.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Space is structural and measured, not expressive. `{spacing.huge}` at 96px between major sections, `{spacing.xxl}` at 60px between blocks, `{spacing.lg}` at 24px inside them. The values repeat exactly; irregular spacing reads as an error in this system in a way it does not in others.

## Elevation & Depth

There is essentially no depth. Levels 0 and 1 are both `none`.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 / 1 | Flat | Everything on a page: cards, panels, sections |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` | Toasts and dropdown menus only |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` | Modals only |

Cards have no border, no shadow, and no background change. A card here is defined purely by its grid position and the space around it. When two blocks need separating, a 1px `{colors.hairline-strong}` rule does it. If a design in this system seems to need a shadow, the grid is not doing its job.

## Shapes

Radius is 0 on structural elements and 2px on controls, which is close enough to square to read as square while softening the pixel edge on buttons and inputs.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.none}` | 0 | Cards, images, modals, tables, badges |
| `{rounded.sm}`, `{rounded.xl}` | 2px | Buttons, inputs, selects |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | Avatars and radio controls only |

**Imagery** is a core element, not decoration. Photographs run at `{rounded.none}` with no border, cropped to align exactly with column boundaries. Black and white or single-color duotone treatments are traditional and still effective. Images should span named column ranges just as text does; an image that does not align to the grid is the most visible possible error here.

**Icons** are 1.5px stroke on a 24px grid, geometric, monochrome. Pictogram-style icons in the Isotype tradition suit the system better than outline UI icons.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 60ms | Hover fills |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 120ms | Button and input states |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 180ms | Menu open, tab change |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 240ms | Modal entry |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 300ms | The longest permitted duration |

Motion here is functional and nearly invisible. There is **no entrance animation**, no scroll-triggered reveal, and no staggered load sequence. A page appears complete.

The standard easing is `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for everything, because a single easing curve applied consistently is more coherent than a curated set. Motion that draws attention to itself is a failure in this direction.

**Reduced motion:** all transitions become instant. Nothing is lost, which is itself a good sign about the motion design.

## Components

### Buttons
`button-primary` is a flat red fill with white bold text and no radius to speak of. `button-secondary` is a 1px black outline that inverts to a black fill on hover. `button-ghost` is text with a 2px red bottom border. All are rectangular with `{spacing.md} {spacing.lg}` padding and left-aligned labels within a fixed width where they sit in a column.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a white field with a 1px black border, which thickens to 2px red on focus. Labels sit above in `{typography.heading-sm}`. Forms follow the grid: a 3+9 split with labels in the narrow column and fields in the wide one is the canonical layout, and it is far more legible than the stacked arrangement most systems default to.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` has no border, no fill, and no shadow. It is content in a grid position with space around it. `nav-bar` is a row with a 1px black bottom rule; the wordmark sits in columns 1-2, navigation in 8-12, and the active item carries a 2px red underline.

### Data
`table-row` uses `{typography.body-sm}` with light `{colors.hairline}` bottom rules, and the header row carries a 1px black rule beneath it. Figures switch to `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`, right-aligned. Column headers are `{typography.overline}`. No vertical rules, no zebra striping.

### Feedback
`badge` is a flat red rectangle with white uppercase text. `toast` is a black rectangle with white text at the bottom-inline-start. `modal` is a white rectangle with a 1px black border over a `{colors.text-primary}` overlay at 48% opacity, unblurred, positioned on the grid rather than centered by default.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Full 12-column grid; asymmetric spans active |
| `lg` | 1024-1439px | 12 columns held; gutter narrows to 24px |
| `md` | 768-1023px | 8-column grid; 5+7 becomes 3+5 |
| `sm` | < 768px | 4-column grid; all splits stack; display-xl to 36px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 80 → 36px, display-lg 52 → 28px, heading-lg 32 → 22px. Tracking scales with it. Body stays at 15px.

**The grid narrows rather than disappears.** At `sm` there are still four columns, and elements still span named ranges (1-3, 2-4) rather than defaulting to full width. Preserving the grid at small sizes is what keeps the system coherent across breakpoints.

**The baseline grid holds at 24px** across every breakpoint, which is the main reason vertical rhythm stays consistent when columns collapse.

**Touch targets** reach 44px by increasing button and row padding on the vertical axis only, so horizontal grid alignment is unaffected.

**RTL** uses logical properties throughout, and the grid mirrors cleanly: a 5+7 split becomes 7+5 with content in the same logical positions. This is one of the easier directions to mirror correctly, since it has no directional ornament.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Honor a 12-column grid and span named ranges for every element, images included.
- Use asymmetric splits: 5+7, 4+8, 3+9.
- Keep to two weights of one family, 400 and 700.
- Set body line-height at 1.5 so adjacent columns share a 24px baseline.
- Use 1px black rules as the only separator.
- Keep red to one element per view.
- Align images exactly to column boundaries.

### Don't
- Don't center anything, including headlines and button labels.
- Don't add shadows to cards, or borders and fills to define them.
- Don't introduce a third weight or a second typeface.
- Don't use red as a background wash or a tint.
- Don't add entrance animations or scroll reveals.
- Don't split a layout into equal halves by default.
- Don't keep the red square while abandoning the grid; that is the faux-Swiss failure.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#ffffff` · Black `#0d0d0d` / `#5c5c5c` · Red `#d42b1e` · Rules 1px black · Radius 0-2px · Grid 12 columns, 36px gutter, 24px baseline · Instrument Sans 400/700 · Anonymous Pro figures.

**Building a page:**

> Build this in the Swiss Grid system. White canvas, black `#0d0d0d` text, Instrument Sans at 400 and 700 only. Twelve-column grid with a 36px gutter; place content in asymmetric spans such as columns 1-5 and 6-12, never equal halves. Headline at 80px weight 700, line-height 0.95, tracking -2.4px, flush left. Body at 15px with line-height 1.5 so columns share a 24px baseline grid. Separators are 1px `#0d0d0d` rules. No shadows, no card borders, no radius above 2px. Exactly one red `#d42b1e` element: the primary button. No entrance animation.

**Building a form:**

> Grid the form as a 3+9 split: labels in columns 1-3 in Instrument Sans 16px bold, fields in columns 4-12 with a 1px black border thickening to 2px red on focus. Errors below the field in `#d42b1e` with a text label, never color alone. Submit as a flat red rectangle, left-aligned in the field column.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. The grid is the design; span named ranges and prefer asymmetric splits.
2. Two weights of one family; hierarchy comes from size and space.
3. One red element per view, applied flat.
