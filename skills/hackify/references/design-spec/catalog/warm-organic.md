  Nothing here has a sharp edge, including the tone of voice. Sand, clay and oat
  build the field, a muted terracotta carries action, and radius scales with the
  element so the page reads as pebbles rather than boxes. Shadows are wide and
  faint, motion decelerates slowly, and line-height runs generous. The system
  exists to lower the stakes of whatever the user is about to do.

## Overview

This system is built to lower the stakes. The field is `{colors.canvas}`, a warm oat that is never pure white, and text is `{colors.text-primary}`, a soft dark brown that is never pure black. Those two decisions do most of the work: a page with no true black and no true white reads as printed on something rather than emitted from something.

Radius is the signature, and it **scales with the element**. Small controls sit at `{rounded.sm}` 10px, cards at `{rounded.lg}` 20px, and large containers and modals at `{rounded.xl}` 32px. A single uniform radius everywhere is the most common way this direction gets built wrong: it produces rounded boxes, where the goal is pebbles of different sizes.

Terracotta `{colors.accent}` carries every action. It is muted rather than saturated, sitting close enough to the sand palette that it never shouts, while still reading clearly as the thing to press. Semantic colors are shifted warm to match, so even an error feels survivable, which for a wellness or finance product aimed at anxious users is the entire point.

**Signature moves:**
- Radius that scales with element size: 10px controls, 20px cards, 32px containers.
- No pure black and no pure white anywhere in the palette.
- Wide, faint shadows at 5 to 12% opacity that read as ambient light rather than depth.
- Generous line-height, 1.65 or more on body, with a comfortable 16px base.
- Motion that settles with a slight overshoot instead of snapping.
- Pill-shaped buttons and badges, so no interactive element has a corner.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent
- **Terracotta** (`{colors.accent}` — `#9c4a2a`): every primary action, active state, focus ring, and inline link. Contrast against `{colors.on-accent}` is 5.65:1, so white-on-terracotta is safe at body size.
- **Terracotta Hover / Press** (`{colors.accent-hover}` — `#b25733`, `{colors.accent-press}` — `#7d3a20`).
- **On Accent** (`{colors.on-accent}` — `#faf5ee`): the canvas oat, not white, so the button feels part of the page.

### Surface
- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — `#faf5ee`): warm oat page background.
- **Surface** (`{colors.surface}` — `#ffffff`): cards and inputs. This is the one place pure white appears, and it works because it is surrounded by warmth.
- **Surface Sunken** (`{colors.surface-sunken}` — `#f2ebe0`): row hover, disabled fills, badges, quiet sections.
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — `#e6ddd0`) and **Hairline Strong** (`{colors.hairline-strong}` — `#d2c5b3`): table rules and input borders.

### Text
- **Bark** (`{colors.text-primary}` — `#2e2823`): body and headings. Contrast on canvas 13.41:1.
- **Bark Secondary** (`{colors.text-secondary}` — `#6b6058`): supporting copy, labels, captions. Contrast 5.63:1.
- **Bark Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — `#96897d`): placeholders, disabled, timestamps.

### Semantic
**Positive** (`{colors.positive}` — `#4a7c52`), **Caution** (`{colors.caution}` — `#855f1f`), **Negative** (`{colors.negative}` — `#a94436`). All shifted warm and desaturated so they belong to the same family as the accent. Negative is deliberately close to terracotta in hue; it is distinguished by context and by an accompanying icon or label, never by color alone.

## Typography

### Font Family

`Fraunces` is the reason this direction works. It is a variable serif with `SOFT` and `WONK` axes: the `SOFT` axis rounds the terminals and joints, and setting it high is what makes headings feel hand-made rather than typeset. Set `font-variation-settings: "SOFT" 60` on display roles. Without that axis engaged, Fraunces reads as a conventional display serif and the direction loses its character.

`Karla` carries body copy. It is a grotesque with slightly quirky proportions and a large x-height, warm enough to sit beside Fraunces without competing. `Martian Mono` handles figures; its wide, soft-cornered forms keep numerics from feeling clinical, though it needs a small negative tracking at body sizes because its default advance is very wide.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line height | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 54px | 600 | 1.12 | -0.8px | Page hero |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 38px | 600 | 1.18 | -0.5px | Section opener |
| `{typography.heading-lg}` | 28px | 600 | 1.25 | -0.2px | Card or panel title |
| `{typography.heading-md}` | 21px | 600 | 1.3 | 0 | Sub-section |
| `{typography.heading-sm}` | 17px | 700 | 1.4 | 0 | Form group (body face) |
| `{typography.body-lg}` | 18px | 400 | 1.7 | 0 | Lead paragraph |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.65 | 0 | Default body |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 | Supporting text, table cells |
| `{typography.caption}` | 13px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Helper text |
| `{typography.overline}` | 12px | 700 | 1.3 | 0.1em | Uppercase section label |
| `{typography.button}` | 16px | 700 | 1 | 0 | Button labels |
| `{typography.numeric}` | 15px | 400 | 1.5 | -0.02em | Figures, `tnum` on |

### Principles

- **Engage the `SOFT` axis.** Every Fraunces role sets `font-variation-settings: "SOFT" 60`. This is not optional; it is the typographic signature.
- **Line-height never drops below 1.5.** Generous leading is what makes the system feel unhurried. Compressing it to fit more content defeats the purpose.
- **Body starts at 16px.** This direction commonly serves users who are stressed, tired, or older. 14px body is a failure of the brief.
- **Overlines use the body face, not the mono.** Mono uppercase reads technical, which fights the tone.
- **Sentence case everywhere except overlines.** Title Case headings read corporate.

## Layout

**Base unit: 4px**, but the scale starts at 8px for anything spatial. The steps run 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 88, which is generous throughout and reflects that this direction spends space freely.

**Container** maxes at 1120px, narrower than typical, because content here is meant to be read rather than scanned across.

**Grid** is 12 columns with a 24px gutter, but the common layouts are simple: a single centered column at 680px for content, or a 8+4 split for content with a supporting card rail. Complex asymmetric grids fight the calm.

**Whitespace philosophy.** Spend it. `{spacing.huge}` at 88px between major sections, `{spacing.xxl}` at 48px between subsections, `{spacing.lg}` at 24px inside cards. Elements are grouped by proximity with clear gaps, so nothing needs a divider line. If a layout feels cramped, the answer is always more space rather than smaller type.

## Elevation & Depth

The depth medium is **ambient light**: wide, very faint shadows with no visible edge.

| Level | Treatment | Use |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Flat | Sections on the canvas, quiet groupings |
| 1 | `{elevation.1}` | Cards, buttons at rest |
| 2 | `{elevation.2}` | Hovered cards, toasts, popovers |
| 3 | `{elevation.3}` | Modals and sheets |

Shadow opacity stays between 5% and 12% and blur radius stays large relative to offset (a 2px offset with an 8px blur, a 24px offset with a 64px blur). A tight, dark shadow reads as a drop shadow from a different design language and immediately breaks the softness.

Cards get shadows rather than borders here, which is the opposite of `industrial-precision`. A border on a card in this system creates a hard edge that the whole direction is trying to avoid.

## Shapes

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{rounded.xs}` | 6px | Checkboxes, small chips, inline code |
| `{rounded.sm}` | 10px | Small controls, segment buttons |
| `{rounded.md}` | 14px | Inputs, selects, textareas |
| `{rounded.lg}` | 20px | Cards, panels, images |
| `{rounded.xl}` | 32px | Modals, sheets, large feature containers |
| `{rounded.pill}` | 9999px | All buttons, badges, avatars, progress tracks |

**The scaling rule is the point.** An element's radius is chosen by its size, not by a global default. A 32px radius on a small button looks like a mistake; a 10px radius on a modal looks like an app from a different system.

**Imagery** sits at `{rounded.lg}` with no border and no shadow, typically 4:3 or 1:1. Illustration, where used, should be flat with the palette's warm tones and rounded forms, avoiding outlined cartoon styles that fight the type. Icons are 2px stroke with rounded caps and joins on a 24px grid.

## Motion

| Token | Duration | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{motion.duration.instant}` | 100ms | Color-only changes |
| `{motion.duration.fast}` | 200ms | Button and input states |
| `{motion.duration.base}` | 320ms | Card hover lift, accordion |
| `{motion.duration.slow}` | 460ms | Modal and sheet entry |
| `{motion.duration.deliberate}` | 720ms | Page-load reveal, once per view |

**The `move` easing carries a slight overshoot** (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.2, 0.64, 1)`), so elements settle rather than stop. The overshoot is small: enough to feel physical, not enough to feel bouncy. Larger overshoot belongs to `playful-pop`.

**Page-load reveal:** hero elements fade in with an 8px rise, staggered at 60ms, capped at six elements. Slower and softer than most systems, matching the pace of everything else.

**Reduced motion:** honor `prefers-reduced-motion`. Keep opacity transitions, remove all translation and the overshoot easing, which becomes a plain decelerating curve.

## Components

### Buttons
Every button is `{rounded.pill}`. `button-primary` is a terracotta fill at `{elevation.1}` that lifts to `{elevation.2}` on hover and drops to `{elevation.0}` on press, which reads as pressing something physical into the page. `button-secondary` is a white surface with a `{colors.hairline-strong}` border. `button-ghost` is terracotta text with a pill hover fill.

### Inputs & Forms
`input-text` is a white surface at `{rounded.md}` with a soft border that turns terracotta on focus, plus a 3px focus ring at low opacity. The ring is deliberately thicker and softer than in other systems. Labels sit above in `{typography.heading-sm}`, helper text below in `{typography.caption}`, and errors below that in `{colors.negative}` accompanied by an icon, never color alone.

### Cards & Navigation
`card` is a white surface at `{rounded.lg}` with `{elevation.1}` and no border. `nav-bar` sits directly on the canvas with no border and no shadow, becoming a floating pill-shaped bar with `{elevation.2}` once the page scrolls. Active items are terracotta text with a pill-shaped `{colors.surface-sunken}` fill.

### Data
Tables are used sparingly. `table-row` carries `{typography.body-sm}` with a `{colors.hairline}` bottom rule and generous `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}` padding. Figures use `{typography.numeric}` with `tnum`. On mobile, tables become stacked cards rather than scrolling, since dense comparison is not this direction's job.

### Feedback
`badge` is a pill on `{colors.surface-sunken}` in uppercase `{typography.overline}`. `toast` inverts to a `{colors.text-primary}` fill with canvas text at `{rounded.md}`. `modal` is a `{rounded.xl}` white sheet at `{elevation.3}` over a `{colors.text-primary}` overlay at 32% opacity, unblurred. On native, modals present as bottom sheets with a visible grab handle.

## Platform & Responsive

| Breakpoint | Width | Key changes |
|---|---|---|
| `xl` | ≥ 1440px | Content column plus card rail; full 88px section rhythm |
| `lg` | 1024–1439px | Rail narrows; rhythm holds |
| `md` | 768–1023px | Rail moves below content; cards go 2-up |
| `sm` | < 768px | Single column; cards 1-up; display-xl drops 54 → 32px |

**Type ramp on small screens:** display-xl 54 → 32px, display-lg 38 → 26px, heading-lg 28 → 22px. Body stays at 16px. Line-height stays at 1.65 or increases; it never compresses.

**Section rhythm** drops from 88px to 48px at `sm`, which is still generous. Card radius drops from 20px to 16px so cards do not look like circles at narrow widths.

**Touch targets** are 48pt minimum on native, larger than the usual 44, matching the unhurried feel and the likely audience.

**Native specifics:** dark-content status bar on the light canvas. Modals are bottom sheets with grab handles and spring dismissal. Haptics fire on primary actions, selection changes, and destructive confirmations, and the selection-change haptic matters here because tactile feedback reinforces the softness. Dynamic Type is honored to the largest accessibility sizes, with layouts reflowing to single-column rather than clipping.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Scale radius with element size: 10px controls, 20px cards, 32px containers.
- Engage the `SOFT` axis on every Fraunces role.
- Keep line-height at 1.65 or more on body copy.
- Use wide, faint shadows on cards instead of borders.
- Keep buttons and badges fully pill-shaped.
- Pair error color with an icon or label, never color alone.
- Spend whitespace freely; group by proximity instead of by divider lines.

### Don't
- Don't use pastel purple or pink. That is the canonical AI-design cliché and it is adjacent to this palette.
- Don't apply one uniform radius to everything; the scaling is the signature.
- Don't mix in cold greys. Every neutral in this system is warm.
- Don't use pure black text or pure white page background.
- Don't add bouncy spring motion; a small settle is the limit.
- Don't compress line-height or drop body below 16px to fit more content.
- Don't put a border on a card. The hard edge fights the entire direction.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Token quick reference.** Canvas `#faf5ee` · Surface `#ffffff` · Bark `#2e2823` / `#6b6058` · Terracotta `#9c4a2a` · Radius 10 / 20 / 32 by element size · Shadows 5 to 12% opacity, wide blur · Fraunces `SOFT 60` display, Karla body, Martian Mono figures.

**Building a screen:**

> Build this in the Warm Organic system. Warm oat canvas `#faf5ee`, white cards with no border and a wide faint shadow `0 2px 8px rgba(46,40,35,0.05)`. Headings in Fraunces 600 with `font-variation-settings: "SOFT" 60`. Body in Karla 16px at 1.65 line-height. Radius scales with element: 10px on small controls, 14px inputs, 20px cards, 32px modals. All buttons fully pill-shaped, terracotta `#9c4a2a` fill for primary. Section gaps of 88px. Transitions 320ms with a gentle settle, `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.2, 0.64, 1)`. No pure black, no pure white background, no cold greys, no purple.

**Building a form:**

> Fields on white at 14px radius with a `#d2c5b3` border, turning `#9c4a2a` on focus with a soft 3px focus ring. Labels above in Karla 17px bold, helper text below in 13px `#6b6058`, errors in `#a94436` with a warning icon beside the text. Submit as a pill-shaped terracotta button with a shadow that lifts on hover and flattens on press.

**The three rules that survive everything else:**
1. Radius scales with element size; a single uniform radius kills it.
2. No pure black, no pure white, no cold grey, no purple.
3. Generous line-height and generous space, always.
