# DESIGN.md — Spec Contract

The binding anatomy of a hackify design spec. A `DESIGN.md` is the **committed visual contract** for a product: machine-readable tokens a coding agent can resolve, and prose a human can argue with. Code is written against it and reviewed against it.

Load this file when authoring, refreshing, extracting, or auditing a spec. Governed by [frontend-design.md](../frontend-design.md) (the visual law); direction choice comes from [direction-library.md](direction-library.md).

---

## Output contract

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `<project>/docs/design/DESIGN.md` | the spec (this contract) |
| `<project>/docs/design/preview.html` | self-contained visual catalog, light + dark toggle |

One spec per product. A design system spanning several apps lives once, at the repo that owns the tokens; downstream apps reference it, never fork it.

**Never** author a second spec beside an existing one. Refresh the existing file (see [extract-protocol.md](extract-protocol.md), REFRESH mode).

---

## File anatomy

Two halves, in this order, no exceptions:

```
---
<YAML frontmatter — the token layer, machine-resolvable>
---

<prose sections — the reasoning layer, human-readable>
```

The frontmatter is the source of truth for values. The prose explains *why* and states the rules a value alone cannot carry. When they disagree, the frontmatter wins and the prose is a bug.

---

## Frontmatter schema

### Header

```yaml
version: 1
name: <Direction Name> — <Product> design spec
direction: <slug from direction-library.md>
platforms: [web, native]        # or [web] / [native]
description: >
  Two to four sentences. What the surface feels like, what the dominant
  color field is, what the type does, and the one signature move that makes
  it recognizable. Written so an agent reading ONLY this paragraph would
  build something close.
```

`direction` MUST be one of the twelve slugs in [direction-library.md](direction-library.md), or `custom` with a `direction_rationale` key explaining why none fit.

**Optional: `accentIsFill: true`.** Set this when the direction uses its accent and semantic colors as **fill** colors carrying dark text, never as text colors on the canvas (`playful-pop` is the catalog example). It changes how contrast is judged: those roles are measured against the text that sits on them rather than against `canvas`, because scoring them against the canvas would be scoring a usage the spec forbids. Defaults to `false`. The conformance checker reads this key, so declaring it is what keeps an intentional design decision from reading as an accessibility failure.

### colors

A flat map of **role name → hex**. Role names describe the job, never the hue.

```yaml
colors:
  canvas:          "#0b0d0e"     # page background
  surface:         "#141719"     # raised panel
  surface-sunken:  "#08090a"     # wells, inputs, code blocks
  hairline:        "#23282b"     # 1px borders, dividers
  hairline-strong: "#333a3e"     # emphasized borders, focused inputs
  text-primary:    "#e8ebec"
  text-secondary:  "#9aa4a8"
  text-muted:      "#6b7579"
  accent:          "#ffb020"     # the single signal color
  accent-hover:    "#ffc14d"
  accent-press:    "#d98f0f"
  on-accent:       "#0b0d0e"     # text ON the accent fill
  positive:        "#3fa66a"
  caution:         "#c9962c"
  negative:        "#d0503f"
  focus-ring:      "#ffb020"
```

Rules:

- **Roles, not hues.** `accent`, not `amber`. `canvas`, not `black`. A rename of the hue must not force a rename of every usage.
- **One accent.** Exactly one `accent` family (base + hover + press + on-accent). A second signal color needs a documented reason in the Colors prose section.
- **Semantic set is separate from accent.** `positive` / `caution` / `negative` carry state meaning. Never reuse `accent` as `positive`.
- **`on-*` for every fill.** Any color used as a fill behind text ships a matching `on-<name>` so contrast is decided once, in the spec.
- **Hex, lowercase, 6 digits.** No `rgba()` in the token layer. Transparency lives in `elevation` or component entries.
- **12–20 entries.** Fewer than 12 means roles are missing; more than 20 means hue names crept in.

### typography

A map of **role → type spec**. Every role carries the full set; no inheritance, no partial entries.

```yaml
typography:
  display-xl:
    fontFamily: "{fonts.display}"
    fontSize: 56px
    fontWeight: 500
    lineHeight: 1.05
    letterSpacing: -1.2px
    fontFeature: ss01
  body-md:
    fontFamily: "{fonts.body}"
    fontSize: 15px
    fontWeight: 400
    lineHeight: 1.55
    letterSpacing: 0
  numeric:
    fontFamily: "{fonts.mono}"
    fontSize: 14px
    fontWeight: 450
    lineHeight: 1.4
    letterSpacing: 0
    fontFeature: tnum
```

Required roles (name them exactly): `display-xl`, `display-lg`, `heading-lg`, `heading-md`, `heading-sm`, `body-lg`, `body-md`, `body-sm`, `caption`, `overline`, `button`, `numeric`. Add more only when a real surface needs them.

`fontFeature` is an OpenType feature string (`tnum`, `ss01`, `zero`, `case`) or omitted.

### fonts

Named families, resolved by the `{fonts.*}` refs above.

```yaml
fonts:
  display:
    name: "Fraunces"
    substitute: "Fraunces"                  # open-source, freely available
    stack: "'Fraunces', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif"
  body:
    name: "Public Sans"
    substitute: "Public Sans"
    stack: "'Public Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif"
  mono:
    name: "JetBrains Mono"
    substitute: "JetBrains Mono"
    stack: "'JetBrains Mono', ui-monospace, 'SF Mono', Menlo, monospace"
```

Rules:

- **`stack` always ends in a generic family** (`serif` / `sans-serif` / `monospace`) and contains at least one font present on a stock machine. The preview renders with zero network access, so the fallback is what most readers will actually see.
- **`substitute` is a freely-licensed family** an implementer can install today. When `name` is proprietary, `substitute` MUST differ from it and the Typography prose MUST say how the substitute is tuned to approximate the original (weight, tracking, feature settings).
- **Never** cite a webfont URL anywhere in the spec or the preview.
- The banned-by-default families of [frontend-design.md](../frontend-design.md) stay banned as the *display* face.

### spacing, rounded, elevation, motion

```yaml
spacing:  { xxs: 2px, xs: 4px, sm: 8px, md: 12px, lg: 16px, xl: 24px, xxl: 32px, huge: 64px }

rounded:  { none: 0, xs: 2px, sm: 4px, md: 8px, lg: 12px, xl: 20px, pill: 9999px }

elevation:
  0: "none"
  1: "0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.28)"
  2: "0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.34)"
  3: "0 24px 64px rgba(0,0,0,0.42)"

motion:
  duration: { instant: 75ms, fast: 150ms, base: 240ms, slow: 420ms, deliberate: 700ms }
  easing:
    enter: "cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)"
    exit:  "cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)"
    move:  "cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)"
  reduced: "respect prefers-reduced-motion — opacity only, no transform, no parallax"
```

One base unit for `spacing` (4px or 8px), stated in the Layout prose. `elevation` levels are 0–3; a fourth level means the surface hierarchy is unclear.

### components

Named entries composed **only** from `{token.ref}` values. A raw hex or a bare pixel value in a component entry is a contract violation.

```yaml
components:
  button-primary:
    backgroundColor: "{colors.accent}"
    textColor: "{colors.on-accent}"
    typography: "{typography.button}"
    rounded: "{rounded.sm}"
    padding: "{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}"
    border: "none"
    elevation: "{elevation.0}"
  button-primary-hover:
    backgroundColor: "{colors.accent-hover}"
    textColor: "{colors.on-accent}"
    typography: "{typography.button}"
    rounded: "{rounded.sm}"
    padding: "{spacing.sm} {spacing.lg}"
  input-text:
    backgroundColor: "{colors.surface-sunken}"
    textColor: "{colors.text-primary}"
    typography: "{typography.body-md}"
    rounded: "{rounded.sm}"
    padding: "{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}"
    border: "1px solid {colors.hairline}"
  input-text-focus:
    border: "1px solid {colors.hairline-strong}"
    focusRing: "2px solid {colors.focus-ring}"
```

Required components: `button-primary`, `button-secondary`, `button-ghost`, `input-text`, `card`, `nav-bar`, `table-row`, `badge`, `modal`, `toast`. Interactive components ship their `-hover`, `-focus`, `-press`, and `-disabled` variants as separate entries.

**12–24 component entries.** A spec with 40 entries is documenting screens, not a system.

### platform

The native layer. Present whenever `platforms` includes `native`.

```yaml
platform:
  web:
    baseFontSize: 16px
    containerMax: 1200px
    breakpoints: { sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px, xl: 1440px }
    focusRing: "2px solid {colors.focus-ring}"
    logicalProperties: required      # margin-inline-start, never margin-left
  native:
    touchTargetMin: 44                # pt/dp — both platforms
    safeArea: respected
    statusBarStyle: light-content     # light-content | dark-content
    elevationModel: shadow            # shadow | material
    scrollPhysics: platform-default
    haptics: [primary-action, destructive-confirm]
    dynamicType: supported            # honor OS text-size settings
```

---

## Web ↔ native token mapping

One token set, four renderers. This table is normative: an implementer applying the spec on any listed platform reads the same row.

| Spec token | Web (CSS) | React Native | Flutter | SwiftUI |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `colors.*` | custom property `--color-*` | const map in `theme/colors` | `ColorScheme` / `ThemeExtension` | `Color` set in asset catalog |
| `typography.fontSize` | `font-size` (px → rem) | `fontSize` (dp) | `TextStyle.fontSize` | `.font(.system(size:))` |
| `typography.fontWeight` | `font-weight` | `fontWeight` | `FontWeight.wNNN` | `.fontWeight()` |
| `typography.lineHeight` | `line-height` (unitless) | `lineHeight` (absolute dp) | `TextStyle.height` (ratio) | `.lineSpacing()` (delta) |
| `typography.letterSpacing` | `letter-spacing` | `letterSpacing` | `TextStyle.letterSpacing` | `.tracking()` |
| `typography.fontFeature` | `font-feature-settings` | `fontVariant` | `fontFeatures: [FontFeature]` | `.monospacedDigit()` / feature settings |
| `spacing.*` | `padding` / `gap` | `padding` / `margin` / `gap` | `EdgeInsets` / `SizedBox` | `.padding()` / `Spacer` |
| `rounded.*` | `border-radius` | `borderRadius` | `BorderRadius.circular` | `.clipShape(RoundedRectangle)` |
| `elevation.*` | `box-shadow` | `shadow*` + Android `elevation` | `Material.elevation` / `BoxShadow` | `.shadow(color:radius:x:y:)` |
| `motion.duration` | `transition-duration` | `Animated` / Reanimated duration | `Duration(milliseconds:)` | `.animation(_:value:)` duration |
| `motion.easing` | `cubic-bezier()` | `Easing.bezier()` | `Cubic()` | `.timingCurve()` |
| `platform.focusRing` | `:focus-visible` outline | `accessibilityState` + border | `FocusNode` + border | `.focused()` + overlay |

**Unit rule.** Web values are CSS px. React Native and Flutter read the same number as density-independent pixels; SwiftUI reads it as points. At base density the three are 1:1, so the token layer stays unitless in practice. Do **not** pre-scale values per platform.

**Line-height rule.** The one token that does not map cleanly. Web and Flutter take a ratio; React Native takes an absolute value; SwiftUI takes a delta above the font's natural leading. Store the **ratio** and convert at the adapter: RN `lineHeight = round(fontSize × ratio)`, SwiftUI `lineSpacing = (fontSize × ratio) − fontSize`.

**Elevation rule.** When `elevationModel: material`, Android maps levels 0–3 to Material elevations 0/1/6/12 and iOS keeps the shadow strings. When `shadow`, both platforms use the shadow strings and Android sets a matching `elevation` for correct z-ordering.

## Prose sections

Required, in this order. Each has a job the token layer cannot do.

| # | Section | Job |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `## Overview` | Two to four paragraphs on the atmosphere, plus a `**Signature moves:**` list of 4–7 bullets naming what makes this system recognizable at a glance. |
| 2 | `## Colors` | Group by role (Brand & Accent / Surface / Text / Semantic). One line per token: name, `{ref}`, hex, and where it is used. State the accent's budget: how often it may appear per screen. |
| 3 | `## Typography` | `### Font Family` (why these faces, how the substitute is tuned), `### Hierarchy` (a table of every role: size, weight, line-height, tracking, use), `### Principles` (3–6 rules that make the type read as this system). |
| 4 | `## Layout` | Base unit, section rhythm, container width, grid logic, and the whitespace philosophy in prose. |
| 5 | `## Elevation & Depth` | A table of levels 0–3 with treatment and use. Name the depth *medium*: shadow, border, blur, texture, or color-field. |
| 6 | `## Shapes` | Radius scale table, plus the geometry rules for imagery, avatars, and icons. |
| 7 | `## Motion` | Duration and easing scale, what animates and what must not, the one orchestrated moment per screen, and the reduced-motion behavior. |
| 8 | `## Components` | Grouped by family (Buttons / Inputs / Cards / Navigation / Feedback / Data). Each entry names its token composition and its interactive states in words. |
| 9 | `## Platform & Responsive` | Breakpoint table with key changes, touch targets, collapsing strategy, native idioms, and RTL behavior via logical properties. |
| 10 | `## Do's and Don'ts` | `### Do` and `### Don't`, 5–8 bullets each. The Don'ts are the anti-tells: the specific ways this system gets built wrong. |
| 11 | `## Agent Prompt Guide` | Copy-paste prompts an implementer can hand to a coding agent, plus the token quick-reference. Ends with the three rules that matter most if everything else is forgotten. |

---

## Authoring rules

1. **Size.** 380–470 lines. The complete token set costs roughly 240 lines before any prose (twelve typography roles, twenty component entries with states, the platform block), so a spec much under 380 is missing required tokens. The hard cap on every plugin file is 500 (`rules/hard-caps.md`); a spec pushing past 470 is documenting screens instead of a system.
2. **Every component value is a `{token.ref}`.** Raw hex or bare px inside `components:` is a contract violation.
3. **Every `{ref}` resolves.** A reference to a token that does not exist in the frontmatter is a broken spec.
4. **Accessibility is a value, not a wish.** Body text against its canvas meets WCAG AA (4.5:1); large display text and UI borders meet 3:1. State the measured ratios for `text-primary`, `text-secondary`, and `on-accent` in the Colors section.
5. **No network references.** No font URLs, no CDN links, no remote images. The preview must render offline.
6. **No real brand identity.** A spec must not reproduce a real company's trademarked name, wordmark, or proprietary palette as its own identity.
7. **Direction discipline.** One direction, executed cleanly. A spec that mixes two directions has no point of view (see [frontend-design.md](../frontend-design.md)).
8. **Dark and light.** State which mode is canonical. If both ship, give the inverted values for every color role, not a vague "invert the palette".

---

## Validation checklist

Run before declaring a spec done. Any "no" sends you back to the frontmatter.

1. Does the frontmatter carry all nine blocks (`colors`, `fonts`, `typography`, `spacing`, `rounded`, `elevation`, `motion`, `components`, `platform`)? (yes / no)
2. Do all twelve required typography roles exist? (yes / no)
3. Do all ten required components exist, with states for the interactive ones? (yes / no)
4. Does every `{token.ref}` resolve to a real token? (yes / no)
5. Are there zero raw hex values and zero bare pixel values inside `components:`? (yes / no)
6. Does every font `stack` end in a generic family and include a stock-machine fallback? (yes / no)
7. Are the contrast ratios for `text-primary`, `text-secondary`, and `on-accent` stated and passing? (yes / no)
8. Are all eleven prose sections present, in order? (yes / no)
9. Does the Overview name 4–7 signature moves? (yes / no)
10. Are there zero network references in the spec and the preview? (yes / no)
11. Is the file within 380–470 lines? (yes / no)
12. When `platforms` includes `native`, is the `platform.native` block complete? (yes / no)
