# Ship gate (runtime proof, the app actually runs)

A green test suite is not a running app. Tests, lint, and typecheck prove the code is *well-formed*; they do not prove it **builds**, **boots**, or **serves a request**. A missing environment variable, a broken bundler config, a circular import at module load, a migration that never ran, none of those show up in the triad, and all of them ship a dead app.

The ship gate is the last mechanical proof in Phase 4: run the thing, watch it come up, drive the main flow. It is **always-on in every mode** (full hackify, quick, yolo) and takes no user opt-in.

## The contract

**A leg is blocking when the diff touched something that leg's target consumes. Otherwise it is a recorded skip. Never silently skipped.**

The trigger is **not** "does a run command exist". Almost every repo has one, and gating a README typo fix on booting the app is how a mandatory check gets quietly disabled. The trigger is: *would this diff change what the build produces, what the app does at startup, or what the touched flow returns?*

| Diff touches | Build | Boot | Smoke |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source the build compiles or bundles | blocking | blocking | blocking |
| Config the app reads at startup (env schema, DI wiring, migrations, routes) | blocking | blocking | blocking |
| Only tests, docs, comments, CI config, or editor settings | skip | skip | skip |
| Only styling on a touched screen | blocking | blocking † | blocking (visual) |

Once a leg is blocking:

- A build command that fails → the gate is ❌, Phase 5 does not start, loop back to Phase 3.
- A start command that never reaches ready → ❌, same.
- No runnable target at all for a blocking leg (a library with no entry point, a plugin repo) → **recorded skip** in the Evidence Ledger, with the reason naming what was searched. A skip with no reason is a failed gate, not a passed one.

† Boot is blocking on a style-only diff because the **visual smoke needs the app running**, not because styling changes startup. That is the one row where a leg is triggered by a downstream leg's need rather than by its own; everywhere else each leg answers only for what its own target consumes.

**Judge the trigger from the diff, not from the task type.** "It's only a config change" is exactly the change that breaks startup. When the two columns disagree, the blocking row wins.

## Part 1, DETECT (what can this project run?)

Look for the three legs in the project's own manifest. Read the manifest, do not guess a command; the project's script names are the contract.

| Ecosystem | Where to look | Build leg | Boot leg | Smoke leg |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Node / Bun / Deno | `package.json` `scripts` | `build`, `compile`, `bundle` | `start`, `dev`, `serve`, `preview` | `e2e`, `test:e2e`, `smoke`, `cypress`, `playwright` |
| Python | `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, `manage.py` | `build`, `wheel` | `runserver`, `uvicorn`, `gunicorn`, a `__main__` | `pytest -m e2e`, `behave` |
| Go / Rust | `Makefile`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml` | `go build ./...`, `cargo build` | `go run .`, `cargo run` | `go test -tags e2e`, `cargo test --test e2e` |
| Containerized | `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` | `docker build` | `docker compose up -d` + healthcheck | the compose healthcheck itself |
| Mobile / native | `Podfile`, `build.gradle`, `xcodebuild` | the platform build | simulator/emulator boot | UI-test target |

**Precedence.** A `Makefile` or `justfile` target beats an inferred command; an explicit CI workflow step beats both. If the project's own CI runs it, that is the command this gate runs.

**A leg is "absent" only after you looked.** Record which manifest you read. "No `package.json` scripts.build and no Makefile build target" is a finding; "probably nothing to build" is not.

## Part 2, PROVE (run the legs in order, cheapest first)

Run in this order and stop at the first red. Each leg produces a real, trimmed slice of output for the Evidence Ledger.

**Leg 1, Build.** Run the build from a clean state. A warm incremental build that reuses stale artifacts proves nothing, delete the build cache directory when the ecosystem has one. Pass means exit 0 **and** the expected artifact exists on disk; a build that exits 0 while emitting nothing is a red.

**Leg 2, Boot.** Start the app the way the project starts it, wait for a **ready signal**, then stop it. Never leave a process behind.

- Prefer an explicit readiness probe over a sleep: a health endpoint returning 200, the port accepting a TCP connection, the framework's own "listening on" line in stdout.
- Cap the wait (60s is a sane default) and treat the timeout as a red, with the captured stdout/stderr as the proof sample.
- Capture the startup log even on success. A boot that succeeds while printing an unhandled rejection or a missing-env warning is an Important finding for Phase 5, not a clean pass.
- Always tear down: kill the process group, bring compose down, free the port. A leaked server is a Phase 6 Step C.5 cleanup finding.

**Leg 3, Smoke.** Drive the **critical path this sprint touched**, end to end, against the booted app. Not the whole suite, the one flow a user would notice if it broke.

- HTTP service → request the touched endpoint(s), assert status and shape.
- Web UI → load the touched route in a browser, assert the key element renders and the primary action works; capture a screenshot as the proof sample.
- CLI → run the touched command with real arguments, assert exit code and output.
- Worker / queue → enqueue one job, assert it is consumed and the side effect lands.

If the project already has an e2e or smoke suite, run **that**, scoped to the touched flow, instead of improvising one. Reuse before you rewrite.

## Part 3, RECORD (the gate's rows in the Evidence Ledger)

Three rows, always **present**, in the Phase 4 Evidence Ledger, whether the leg ran or was skipped. Present is not the same as executed: a skipped leg still owns its row and carries its reason. `Type` is `runtime`.

```markdown
| Item | Type | Claim | What I ran | Proof sample | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ship.build | runtime | Project builds clean from a cold cache | `rm -rf dist && bun run build` | `bundled 412 modules in 3.1s → dist/index.js (284 kB)` | ✅ |
| ship.boot | runtime | App boots and reports ready | `bun run start` + poll `GET /healthz` | `listening on :3000` / `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` | ✅ |
| ship.smoke | runtime | Touched flow works against the running app | `curl -s -X POST /api/invitations -d @fixture.json` | `{"id":"inv_7f3","status":"pending"}` (201) | ✅ |
```

**When a leg has no target**, the row still exists and carries the reason:

```markdown
| ship.boot | runtime | No boot target | read `package.json` scripts + `Makefile` | `no start/dev/serve script; library package, `main` only` | ⏭ skipped |
```

`⏭ skipped` is a valid result **only** with a reason naming what was searched. A blank, a "n/a", or a missing row counts as ❌ and blocks Phase 5, same as any other unproven ledger item.

## Part 4, SECRETS AND STATE (do not fake a boot)

- **Use the project's own local config path.** `.env.example` → `.env.local`, the compose file's defaults, the documented dev seed. Never invent credentials, never write a real secret into a file the sprint will commit, and never disable auth to make the smoke pass.
- **Migrations count as part of boot.** If the app needs a schema, run the project's migrate command first and treat its failure as a boot red. A migration that only works on a fresh database is a Critical finding (`sec.migration`).
- **If the app genuinely cannot run locally** (needs a cloud dependency with no local substitute, needs hardware, needs a paid third party), that is a **recorded skip with the blocker named**, and it goes into the work-doc Retrospective as a real gap. It is not a pass. Say plainly which flow is unproven so the user knows what to check by hand before shipping.

## Anti-rationalizations (STOP and apply the reality)

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Tests are green, the app obviously runs" | Tests import modules; they do not start a server, read env, or run migrations. Different failure surface entirely. |
| "There's no e2e suite, so skip the smoke leg" | Absent suite means write one throwaway request, not skip the leg. One `curl` with a real assertion beats no proof. |
| "It booted last time I checked" | Evidence is from THIS turn. A remembered boot is not a proof sample. |
| "The build warning is pre-existing, ignore it" | Capture it, then check it against the sprint-start baseline. Pre-existing goes to Step C.5 class (g); new is a Phase 5 finding. |
| "I'll skip the gate, this is a docs change" | Correct, and the row still gets written: `⏭ skipped, docs-only diff, nothing the build or startup path consumes`. The reason costs one line and keeps the ledger honest. |
| "There is a start script, so I must boot it" | Only if the diff touched something startup consumes. A test-only or docs-only diff skips with a reason. The trigger is the diff, not the manifest. |
| "I'll leave the dev server running for the next step" | Tear it down. A leaked process is a cleanup finding and it will break the next boot by holding the port. |
