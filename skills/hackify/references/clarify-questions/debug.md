# Type: `debug`

Phase 1 loads this bank when the user has a mystery to solve rather than a clear ask, intermittent failures, weird behavior with no reliable reproduction. See [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md) for the canonical 4-section spec.

**SCENARIO**

Use when the user has a mystery to solve rather than a clear ask, weird behavior with no reliable reproduction, intermittent failures, "sometimes X happens and I don't know why." Triggers on patterns like "I'm seeing weird X", "sometimes Y fails", "I can't figure out why", "no error but Z is wrong". Phase 3b's 4-phase debugging method runs during clarify; evidence gathering is part of Phase 1.

**COMPOSITION**

- Q1 wording mirrors `fix` Q1 by design, keep in sync if either is edited.
- Skip Q1 (Reproduction shape) if the user prompt contains BOTH `expected` AND `actual` (same rule as `fix` Q1); else ask Q1 as discovery.
- Always ask Q2 (Evidence collected) and Q3 (Hypotheses tried), they prevent us from re-running work the user already did.
- Always ask Q4 (Instrumentation boundary), gates whether Phase 3b can add logs/telemetry.
- Always ask Q5 (Outcome), determines Phase 6's exit shape.
- Always ask Q6 (Time-box), debug tasks have the highest risk of unbounded exploration.
- Ask Q7 (Cost now) FIRST, before Q1. If something is being lost or corrupted while the problem runs, containment comes before diagnosis and every other answer in this bank is given under a different priority.
- Ask Q8 (Usual causes) when the symptom's shape matches a domain in [domain-mechanisms.md](domain-mechanisms.md): messages arriving sometimes, a duplicate that appears under load, a total that is off by a day, an occasional permission surprise. Skip it when nothing there matches, and say so in the preamble. An invented cause sends the investigation somewhere real evidence never would.
- This bank carries two of the four domain questions rather than four, and both omissions are deliberate. There is no necessity challenge because a debug builds nothing to cut, and no correctness-rule question because what "correct" means here is the thing the investigation is trying to establish; that question belongs to the `fix` bank once the cause is known.
- If the batch runs past the ~16 target, drop Q3 before either of Q7 and Q8, see [picking-and-combining.md](picking-and-combining.md).

**QUESTIONS**

Every question below is a TEMPLATE. Substitute the real names, files and current behavior you found before sending it, so the user can answer without opening anything. Angle-bracket slots are yours to fill. `What happens:` lines are mandatory and are what the user reads.

Q1. Can you make it happen on demand
- Text: Can you make `<the problem, in their words>` happen again reliably by repeating the same steps?
- Header: Repeatable
- Options:
  - A. Yes, every time (Recommended)
    - What happens: I reproduce it myself first. That's the fastest possible route, because I can test each theory directly.
  - B. Sometimes, but not predictably
    - What happens: I add temporary logging to catch it in the act. Slower, but guessing at an intermittent problem usually fixes nothing.
  - C. It happened once and I can't repeat it
    - What happens: I work backwards from whatever evidence exists. I'll tell you honestly if there isn't enough to be sure.
- Why-this-matters: A reliable repro skips Phase 3b's instrumentation-first loop; B and C require evidence gathering before any hypothesis.

Q2. What you already have
- Text: Do you have anything saved from when it went wrong, like an error message, a screenshot, or server logs?
- Header: Evidence
- Options:
  - A. Yes, I'll paste it now (Recommended)
    - What happens: This usually cuts the search dramatically. Even a partial error message narrows it a lot.
  - B. No, nothing saved
    - What happens: I'll tell you exactly what to capture next time it happens, and start from the code meanwhile.
  - C. Some of it, I'll describe what's missing
    - What happens: I'll work with what you have and say clearly what would speed things up.
- Why-this-matters: Determines whether Phase 3b starts from a known-evidence baseline or from zero.

Q3. What you already ruled out
- Text: Have you already tried anything to fix this? Knowing what didn't work saves me repeating it.
- Header: Already tried
- Options:
  - A. Yes, I'll tell you what I tried (Recommended)
    - What happens: I skip those paths and start from where you left off.
  - B. Nothing yet, this is fresh
    - What happens: I start from the beginning with no assumptions.
  - C. I tried a lot and lost track
    - What happens: I'll start clean and work methodically rather than trusting a half-remembered list.
- Why-this-matters: Prevents Phase 3b from re-running failed approaches and seeds the hypothesis list.

Q4. Can I add temporary logging
- Text: To find this, I often need to add temporary logging that prints what the code is doing at each step. It gets removed before anything ships. Is that OK?
- Header: Logging
- Options:
  - A. Yes, go ahead (Recommended)
    - What happens: Much faster diagnosis. I remove every line of it before finishing and prove it's gone.
  - B. Yes, but keep it switched off by default
    - What happens: Slightly slower, but nothing extra ever prints in production.
  - C. No, just read the code
    - What happens: I work from the code alone. Slower and less certain, especially for anything timing-related.
- Why-this-matters: Sets Phase 3b's evidence toolkit and whether Phase 6 Step C.5 carries a remove-instrumentation cleanup item.

Q5. How far you want me to go
- Text: Once I find the cause, do you want me to fix it too, or stop and tell you first?
- Header: Outcome
- Options:
  - A. Find it and fix it (Recommended)
    - What happens: I keep going through to a tested fix and show you the proof it works.
  - B. Find it and explain it, I'll decide on the fix
    - What happens: You get a clear write-up of the cause and your options, with no code changed.
  - C. Get it working now, investigate properly later
    - What happens: I stop the bleeding today and write down what still needs a real fix.
- Why-this-matters: Determines Phase 6's exit shape (fix lands vs report-only vs mitigation plus a follow-up entry).

Q6. When I should check back
- Text: Investigations can run long. At what point do you want me to stop and report what I've found, even if I haven't cracked it?
- Header: Check-in
- Options:
  - A. After a couple of hours of digging (Recommended)
    - What happens: You get an honest progress report and can redirect me before more time goes in.
  - B. After half a day
    - What happens: More room to chase a hard one, less frequent updates.
  - C. Keep going until it's solved
    - What happens: No interruptions. Be aware a genuinely hard bug can absorb a lot of time this way.
- Why-this-matters: Phase 3b inserts a hard checkpoint at the named duration; without it, debug tasks run unbounded past the 3-hypothesis circuit breaker.

Q7. What it's costing you while it stays unsolved
- Text: While this is unsolved, `<state the effect as you understand it, e.g. "some invitation emails never arrive, and those people can't join">`. Who does that hit, and is anything being lost that you couldn't get back?
- Header: Cost now
- Options:
  - A. It's annoying, but nothing is being lost (Recommended)
    - What happens: I take the time to find the real cause rather than reaching for a quick cover-up that hides it.
  - B. People are affected, I need something today
    - What happens: I put a stopgap in first so the bleeding stops, then investigate properly. I'll be clear about which part is the stopgap.
  - C. Something is being lost or written wrong every time it happens
    - What happens: We stop it running before anything else. Then I work out how much was already affected and whether it can be put right.
  - D. I'm not sure what it's touching
    - What happens: I'll trace what this actually reaches and come back with the list before we decide how urgent it is.
- Why-this-matters: Reorders the whole investigation. Answer C makes containment the first Sprint Backlog task and pushes diagnosis behind it, which is the opposite of this bank's default order, and it adds a data-repair task with its own Evidence Ledger row. B splits the work into a stopgap task and an investigation task rather than one. Sits beside Q5, which asks how far to go once the cause is known; this asks what is happening in the meantime. Never state a count of affected records you did not measure, per the honesty rule in [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md).
- Recommend: A leads on the plain reading of most reports. Lead with C whenever the symptom involves money, a write that could be wrong, or anything a person will later dispute, and say why in C's own text.

Q8. The usual causes for this shape of problem
- Text: `<Name the domain and the symptom shape, e.g. "mail that arrives sometimes and not other times is usually about the sending domain's reputation rather than the code">`. The two things that normally cause it are `<mechanism 1 absent, and the symptom that produces>` and `<mechanism 2 absent, and the symptom that produces>`. Do you know whether you have those?
- Header: Usual causes
- Options:
  - A. I don't know, check those first (Recommended)
    - What happens: I check them before I read any code. If one is missing, that is very likely your answer and we're done in minutes rather than hours.
  - B. Those are all in place, it's something else
    - What happens: I rule them out quickly with evidence rather than taking it on trust, then start looking somewhere new.
  - C. One of those is missing, that's probably it
    - What happens: I confirm it's really the cause before changing anything, so we don't fix the obvious thing and leave the real one running.
- Why-this-matters: Seeds the hypothesis list from mechanisms with known failure modes instead of from guessing, which is what the 3-hypothesis circuit breaker keeps running out of. Source them from [domain-mechanisms.md](domain-mechanisms.md), and state each one as an absent mechanism plus the symptom it produces; a bare "this is usually a configuration problem" is banned by the honesty rule in [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md) and would seed nothing testable anyway. Each named mechanism becomes an ordered entry in the Investigation Plan's hypotheses-to-test list.
- Recommend: A leads whenever the mechanisms are cheap to check, which is the usual case. Never lead with C on your own reading; that answer belongs to the user, because presenting a guess as the likely cause is how an investigation stops looking.

**EXIT CRITERIA**

Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7 all answered; Q8 answered if its COMPOSITION trigger fired; when Q7 is answered B or C, containment leads the Investigation Plan and the diagnosis follows it; evidence pasted (or "none yet" explicitly confirmed); hypotheses-tried list captured; instrumentation boundary recorded so Phase 3b knows its toolkit; the work-doc Approach section is replaced by an Investigation Plan with components-to-instrument, evidence-to-gather, and hypotheses-to-test in order.
