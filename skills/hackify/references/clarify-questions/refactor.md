# Type: `refactor`

Phase 1 loads this bank when behavior should NOT change but structure should, moving, renaming, extracting, deduplicating, restoring layer boundaries. See [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md) for the canonical 4-section spec.

**SCENARIO**

Use when behavior should NOT change but structure should, moving code, renaming, extracting, deduplicating, restoring layer boundaries, prepping for an upcoming feature. Triggers on patterns like "clean up X", "extract Y", "consolidate Z", "this is getting messy", "prep for...". Not for user-visible changes (that's `feature` or `revamp`).

**COMPOSITION**

- Always ask Q1 (Driver), drives the Phase 2 plan narrative.
- Always ask Q2 (Behavior contract), the central refactor invariant. If the user names exceptions in the prompt, present them as confirmation.
- If the prompt names the scope (one file, one module, cross-project), skip Q3 (Scope).
- Always ask Q4 (Test coverage), gates whether a "write tests first" sub-phase is inserted.
- Always ask Q5 (Migration shape), determines whether Phase 2 plans a single PR or a staged rollout.
- If the user's prompt cites an exemplar module to mimic, skip Q6 (Pattern reference) and link it in the preamble.
- Ask Q7 (How much) straight after Q1 and BEFORE Q3, Q5 and Q6. Q1 asks why the user wants this; Q7 asks whether the expensive half of it earns its place, and Q3's reach answer means little until that is settled.
- Always ask Q7. A rework with no named payoff is the easiest plan in this workflow to grow without anyone deciding it should, and option D is the only place the user is offered "this may not be worth doing".
- Always ask Q9 (Who breaks). A rename or a move is measured by its callers, not by its own diff, and the user is the only one who knows about callers outside this project.
- Ask Q8 (Target shape) only when the restructured code sits in a domain listed in [domain-mechanisms.md](domain-mechanisms.md). Skip it for a pure rename or a file move with no structural target, and say so in the preamble.
- If the batch runs past the ~16 target, drop in this order: Q6, then Q8, then Q3. Never drop Q7 or Q9, see [picking-and-combining.md](picking-and-combining.md).

**QUESTIONS**

Every question below is a TEMPLATE. Substitute the real names, files and current behavior you found before sending it, so the user can answer without opening anything. Angle-bracket slots are yours to fill. `What happens:` lines are mandatory and are what the user reads.

Q1. What's bothering you about it
- Text: What's the main reason you want `<the real module or area>` reworked?
- Header: Reason
- Options:
  - A. It's hard to read and work with (Recommended)
    - What happens: I focus on making it clearer and simpler, without changing what it does.
  - B. I'm about to add something and this is in the way
    - What happens: Tell me what's coming next and I'll shape it so that lands easily.
  - C. It's too slow
    - What happens: I measure first to find the real bottleneck, then fix that specifically rather than guessing.
  - D. It's doing things it shouldn't, in the wrong place
    - What happens: I move the misplaced logic to where it belongs so the boundaries are clean again.
- Why-this-matters: Frames the Phase 2 plan narrative and selects the Phase 5 reviewer focus (quality vs performance vs layering).

Q2. Should anything look different afterwards
- Text: After this, should anyone using the app notice any difference at all? One thing worth checking: `<name one current behaviour that looks like a bug a faithful rewrite would copy across, e.g. "an empty search box currently returns every record, which may or may not be what you wanted">`.
- Header: Visible change
- Options:
  - A. No, it should behave exactly the same (Recommended)
    - What happens: I capture how it behaves now and prove it still behaves identically afterwards.
  - B. Yes, some things should change too
    - What happens: Tell me which, and I'll treat those as intended rather than as mistakes.
  - C. Some of what it does now is wrong, don't carry that over
    - What happens: Tell me which parts look wrong. I check each one, fix the real bugs, and list them separately from the restructuring so you can see both.
- Why-this-matters: Determines whether a behavior-equivalence check runs in Phase 5 and whether Phase 3 captures a before/after snapshot test. Option C is the correctness half: "behaviour must not change" quietly freezes today's bugs into the new structure, and a rewrite is the cheapest moment to catch one. C splits the Sprint Backlog into restructuring tasks and named fix tasks, each with its own Evidence Ledger row, so the behaviour-equivalence check knows which differences are intended.
- Recommend: A leads on a plain restructure. Lead with C when you found a behaviour in the code that looks unintended, and name it in the question text so the user can judge it without opening anything.

Q3. How much should move
- Text: I found this pattern in `<real file(s) you found>`. Should I stay inside that, or follow it everywhere it appears?
- Header: Reach
- Options:
  - A. Just that area for now (Recommended)
    - What happens: Small and safe. Easy to review, easy to undo.
  - B. That area and the closely related ones
    - What happens: More consistent result, bigger change to read through.
  - C. Everywhere it appears, across the whole project
    - What happens: Nothing left inconsistent, but it's a large change and takes longer to verify.
- Why-this-matters: Decides whether Phase 4 cross-package verification runs and how many waves Phase 3 needs.

Q4. Safety net
- Text: `<State what you found, e.g. "This area has almost no automated tests right now.">` Reworking code with no tests is where silent breakage comes from. How do you want to handle that?
- Header: Safety net
- Options:
  - A. Write tests that capture today's behavior first (Recommended)
    - What happens: Slower to start, but I can prove nothing broke. Without this, neither of us can be sure.
  - B. Go ahead, the existing tests are enough
    - What happens: Faster. I rely on what's already covered and flag anything that looks unprotected.
  - C. Check the coverage first, then decide
    - What happens: I'll report what's actually covered and you choose from there.
- Why-this-matters: Inserts a characterization-test sub-phase in Phase 2 when A or C is selected; gates Phase 3 entry.

Q5. How it should land
- Text: Do you want this as one clean change, or eased in gradually so nothing switches over at once?
- Header: Rollout
- Options:
  - A. One clean change (Recommended)
    - What happens: Simplest to review and reason about. Best when the area is well covered by tests.
  - B. Keep the old way working alongside the new one for a while
    - What happens: Safer for anything other people depend on, but the code holds both versions for a period.
  - C. Put it behind a switch I can flip
    - What happens: You control exactly when it goes live and can turn it back off instantly.
- Why-this-matters: Determines Phase 6 release shape and whether deprecation shims are emitted in Phase 3.

Q6. Is there a good example already
- Text: Is there somewhere in your project that already does this the way you want it done? `<If you spotted a candidate, name it: "e.g. orders/ looks like the shape you're describing.">`
- Header: Example
- Options:
  - A. Yes, copy that pattern (Recommended)
    - What happens: The result matches what you already have, so it looks like the same author wrote it.
  - B. No, suggest a shape and I'll pick
    - What happens: I'll show you two or three options with the trade-offs before writing anything.
- Why-this-matters: Phase 2 mimics the named exemplar verbatim; without one, Phase 2 spends time deriving the target shape.

Q7. What this actually unblocks, and how much has to move for it
- Text: A rework like this earns its cost when something specific gets easier afterwards. From what you've told me that's `<the named payoff, or "nothing specific yet">`. The smallest change that delivers it is `<the minimum, named concretely, e.g. "the three copies of the price calculation become one function and everything else stays put">`. Reworking all of `<the real module>` instead touches `<the difference in countable things: how many files, whether the database changes, how many callers get edited>`. Which?
- Header: How much
- Options:
  - A. Just the part that pays off (Recommended)
    - What happens: I make `<the small change>` and stop. `<what stays exactly as it is>`. Small enough to read in one sitting and simple to undo.
  - B. That, plus `<the one adjacent piece worth doing while I'm here>`
    - What happens: `<the small change>` plus `<the adjacent piece>`, and nothing past that. `<one line on why this one earns its place and the others don't>`.
  - C. All of it, I want the whole area consistent
    - What happens: Every place matching this pattern moves. Longer to review and slower to verify, and it does leave nothing half-done behind.
  - D. Is this worth doing at all?
    - What happens: I'll tell you straight whether it earns its cost right now, including the honest answer that it might not, and what leaving it alone would cost you later.
- Why-this-matters: This is the necessity challenge and it fills Out-of-Scope / Non-Goals directly. Restructuring is the task type with no user-visible outcome to anchor scope, so the plan grows on feel unless something asks what the payoff is. Option D MUST be a real answer you are willing to give, not a strawman: "the duplication is in three places and none of them changes often, so this can wait" is a legitimate result of this question. State size differences in countable things, never in days, per the honesty rule in [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md).
- Recommend: A leads whenever a named smaller change delivers the payoff. Lead with D when you looked and found no payoff at all; saying so is more useful than a tidy plan for work nobody needed.

Q8. The shape you're moving it to
- Text: `<Name the domain and the current shape, e.g. "right now each screen queries the database directly">`. The structure that holds up does `<mechanism 1, and the failure it prevents>` and `<mechanism 2, and the failure it prevents>`. Is that the shape you want it moved into?
- Header: Target shape
- Options:
  - A. Yes, move it to that (Recommended)
    - What happens: The result matches a shape with known reasons behind it, and I can say for each piece which failure it prevents.
  - B. Partly, just `<the one piece that matters here>`
    - What happens: I move that piece and leave the rest as it is. Less to review, and the rest stays available to do later.
  - C. I've got a different shape in mind, let me describe it
    - What happens: Describe it and I'll follow yours, and say clearly if I think any part of it will hurt.
  - D. What does each part actually buy me?
    - What happens: I go through them one at a time with the failure each one prevents, and you pick.
- Why-this-matters: A refactor with no named target shape becomes a matter of taste, and taste is what makes the Phase 5 quality review unarguable in both directions. Source the mechanisms from [domain-mechanisms.md](domain-mechanisms.md) and never state one without the failure it prevents, per the honesty rule in [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md). The accepted shape becomes the Approach section and the standard Reviewer B judges the diff against.
- Recommend: A leads when the current shape is causing something you can name from the code. Lead with B when only one mechanism is missing, and say which in B's own text.

Q9. Who's standing on this today
- Text: `<State what you found, e.g. "seventeen files call this function directly, and two of those run in your scheduled jobs">`. Moving or renaming it changes every one of them. How should that be handled?
- Header: Who breaks
- Options:
  - A. Update them all in one go (Recommended)
    - What happens: Nothing is left pointing at the old shape, so there's no half-moved state to trip over later. Bigger to read through in one sitting.
  - B. Keep the old way working beside the new one, move callers gradually
    - What happens: Safer when other services or other people's code call this. The project carries both versions for a while, and I'll write down when the old one goes.
  - C. Only the callers I'm touching anyway
    - What happens: The smallest change now. The area ends up half old and half new, which is harder to read than either shape on its own.
  - D. I don't know what depends on it, find out first
    - What happens: I'll list every place that uses it, inside this project and as far outside as I can see, before either of us decides.
- Why-this-matters: A rename is measured by its callers, not by its own diff, and callers outside this repository are invisible to every tool here. Sits beside Q5 rather than replacing it: Q5 asks how the change is released, this asks who has to change with it. Answer B makes deprecation shims a Sprint Backlog task and adds a back-compat lens in Phase 5; D inserts a consumer sweep before the plan is drafted. Never state a caller count you did not grep for, per the honesty rule in [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md).
- Recommend: A leads when every caller lives in this project, which you can check. B leads whenever anything outside this repository calls it, because you cannot edit what you cannot see, and say that plainly in B's text.

**EXIT CRITERIA**

Q1, Q2, Q4, Q5, Q7, Q9 answered (always required); Q3, Q6, Q8 answered if their COMPOSITION trigger fired; the Q7 payoff written down in the user's own words, or its absence recorded when the answer is D; behavior-contract decision and migration shape captured in the work-doc; if Q4 = B, the work-doc Tasks list opens with a "write characterization tests" task before any structural change.
