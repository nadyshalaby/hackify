# Type: `fix`

Phase 1 loads this bank when the user is reporting broken behavior with a clear reproduction. See [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md) for the canonical 4-section spec.

**SCENARIO**

Use when the user is reporting broken behavior, an observable defect, a stack trace, a flow that no longer produces the expected outcome. Triggers on patterns like "X is broken", "Y doesn't work", "throws an error", "regressed since...". Not for mysteries with no clear reproduction (that's `debug`).

**COMPOSITION**

**These labels were wrong from 0.2.6 to 0.16.0**, naming Q2 as "Frequency", Q3 as "Recent changes", Q4 as "Regression scope" and Q5 as "Severity", off by one against QUESTIONS from Q2 down. All four arrived when this bank was split out of a larger file (`895c9da`, measured with `git log -S` on each label); the duplicate second Q6 came later, at `c7e1481`. Every number cited did exist, so the dangling-reference check stayed green while a model following the labels asked the wrong question. Re-mapped below against the QUESTIONS section as it actually stands.

- Skip Q1 (Repeatable) and confirm in the preamble if the user prompt contains BOTH the substring `expected` AND `actual`, OR any of the literal substrings `always`, `every time`, `intermittently`, `once`, `sometimes`, all of which already answer it.
- Skip Q2 (Trigger) if the user prompt contains any of `started failing`, `regressed`, `after the`, `since we merged`.
- Always ask Q3 (Reach), silently affected flows are the top source of incomplete fixes.
- Always ask Q4 (Urgency), it determines the polish-versus-ship trade-off.
- Always ask Q5 (Depth), it gates whether Phase 3 dispatches a refactor task alongside the fix.
- Always ask Q6 (Guard), defaults to A; the only gate that prevents silent re-breakage. Q1 wording aligns with `debug` Q1 by design (keep in sync if either is edited).
- Ask Q7 (What's right) straight after Q1, before Q4 and Q5. "Broken" names what the system does; it does not name what it should do, and every later answer assumes that is settled.
- Always ask Q9 (Damage). A bug that ran in production wrote records while it was wrong, and a fix that repairs the code and leaves the records is a half fix. Skip only when the user's own prompt says it never reached real use.
- Ask Q8 (Prevention) when the bug belongs to a class named in [domain-mechanisms.md](domain-mechanisms.md): a double charge, a lost message, a permission leak, a timezone slip, a retry that ran twice. Skip it when the bug is a one-off mistake with no class behind it, and say so in the preamble.
- If the batch runs past the ~16 target, drop in this order: Q2, then Q8. Never drop Q7 or Q9, see [picking-and-combining.md](picking-and-combining.md).

**QUESTIONS**

Every question below is a TEMPLATE. Substitute the real names, files and current behavior you found before sending it, so the user can answer without opening anything. Angle-bracket slots are yours to fill. `What happens:` lines are mandatory and are what the user reads.

Q1. Can you make it happen on demand
- Text: Can you make `<the bug, in their words>` happen again whenever you want, by following the same steps?
- Header: Repeatable
- Options:
  - A. Yes, every time, and here are the steps (Recommended)
    - What happens: I reproduce it myself first, so I'm certain I'm fixing the real thing and not guessing.
  - B. It happens sometimes, not every time
    - What happens: I'll gather evidence first to find the pattern. Slower, but an intermittent bug fixed by guesswork usually comes back.
  - C. It happened once and I can't repeat it
    - What happens: I'll investigate properly from logs and code before changing anything, rather than patching a symptom.
- Why-this-matters: Routes the task: stay in `fix` flow (A) vs escalate to Phase 3b evidence-gathering (B/C). No reliable repro means no honest RED test.

Q2. Did something change just before it started
- Text: Do you remember anything changing around the time this started, like a release, an update, or a settings change?
- Header: Trigger
- Options:
  - A. Yes, I know roughly what changed (Recommended)
    - What happens: I look there first, which is usually the fastest route to the real cause.
  - B. No, it just started on its own
    - What happens: I'll trace it from the symptom backwards instead of from a suspected change.
  - C. No idea, can you work it out
    - What happens: I'll walk back through your project's history to find the commit where it broke.
- Why-this-matters: Determines whether Phase 1 ends with a bisect step or goes straight to root-cause analysis.

Q3. How far it spreads
- Text: As far as you know, does this break only `<the specific flow they named>`, or have you seen it affect other things too?
- Header: Reach
- Options:
  - A. Just that one thing (Recommended)
    - What happens: I keep the fix tight and focused on that flow.
  - B. That, plus a few related things
    - What happens: I check the related areas too and make sure the fix covers all of them.
  - C. It seems to affect lots of unrelated places
    - What happens: That usually means something shared underneath is broken. I'll find that instead of patching each place.
- Why-this-matters: Decides whether Phase 4 cross-package verification runs and whether Reviewer F's seam sweep needs a wider consumer grep.

Q4. How urgent
- Text: How much is this hurting you right now?
- Header: Urgency
- Options:
  - A. It's blocking people, I need the fastest safe fix (Recommended)
    - What happens: I make the smallest change that genuinely fixes it, and leave any tidying for later.
  - B. It's annoying but nothing is stopping
    - What happens: I fix it properly and tidy the surrounding area while I'm in there.
  - C. No rush, do it whenever
    - What happens: I take the time to fix the underlying cause well, even if that means a bigger change.
- Why-this-matters: Trades Phase 3 minimum-diff against a broader refactor, and whether Phase 6 fast-paths to a hotfix.

Q5. Patch it or fix the cause
- Text: `<State what you found, e.g. "The immediate cause looks like a missing check in checkout.ts, but the deeper reason is that nothing validates the cart before payment.">` Which do you want?
- Header: Depth
- Options:
  - A. Fix the underlying cause properly (Recommended)
    - What happens: Takes a bit longer, but this class of bug stops coming back.
  - B. Just patch the immediate problem for now
    - What happens: Quickest route to working. The same root cause can bite again elsewhere.
  - C. Patch it now, and write down the real fix for later
    - What happens: You get it working today, plus a written note of what still needs doing.
- Why-this-matters: Determines whether Phase 3 dispatches one implementer or also a refactor task, and whether a Retrospective follow-up is filed.

Q6. Guard against it returning
- Text: Do you want me to add an automated check that fails if this exact bug ever comes back?
- Header: Guard
- Options:
  - A. Yes, please (Recommended)
    - What happens: I prove the check really catches this bug by making it fail on purpose first, then pass with the fix in place. That's how you know it's real.
  - B. No, just fix it
    - What happens: Quicker now. Nothing stops this breaking again silently in a future change.
- Why-this-matters: Determines whether the testing wave owes a watched RED that reproduces this exact bug. The check is authored there, against the landed fix, and it is proven by reverting the fix and requiring a red that names it. Recommend A unconditionally unless the user prompt contains `no test`, `quick fix only`, or `can't test`.

Q7. What "working properly" should actually look like
- Text: `<State the wrong behaviour and the candidate right ones with real values, e.g. "an invite sent at 11pm on the 30th currently stops working at 11pm on the 7th. Should the seven days be counted from the moment it was sent, or in whole days so it always expires at midnight?">`
- Header: What's right
- Options:
  - A. `<the first candidate, in plain words>` (Recommended)
    - What happens: `<what people will see, stated concretely, and what it means for the records already stored>`.
  - B. `<the second candidate, in plain words>`
    - What happens: `<the same, for this answer>`.
  - C. I hadn't thought about it, what do you suggest?
    - What happens: I'll tell you which answers hold up here and what each one costs, then you pick and I build that.
- Why-this-matters: "It's broken" describes what the system does, never what it should do, and a fix built on an unstated assumption is a second bug with a nicer name. Draw the candidates from "Correctness rules that bite here" for the matched domain in [domain-mechanisms.md](domain-mechanisms.md). The answer becomes the Acceptance Criteria bullet AND the assertion inside the RED test, so it has to be a real value, not a direction.
- Recommend: Lead with whichever answer the mechanism supports, not whichever is a smaller diff. Where both are genuinely defensible, say that in the option's own text instead of projecting certainty.

Q8. Stopping the whole class, or just this one
- Text: `<Name the class this bug belongs to, e.g. "this is a duplicate charge caused by a retry after a timeout">`. `<State the mechanism that prevents the class, and the failure it prevents, in one sentence>`. Do you want that put in, or just this one occurrence closed?
- Header: Prevention
- Options:
  - A. Put the mechanism in (Recommended)
    - What happens: This bug is fixed and the next one of its kind cannot happen. `<one line on what that adds, in countable things>`.
  - B. Just close this one
    - What happens: Quickest route back to working. The same cause can produce a different version of this bug somewhere else, and I'll write down where.
  - C. What would the mechanism cost?
    - What happens: I come back with what it adds in places to edit and whether the database changes, then you choose.
- Why-this-matters: Sits beside Q5 rather than replacing it. Q5 asks how deep to go into THIS bug's cause; this asks whether to add the mechanism that makes the class impossible, which is a different and usually larger decision. A adds a task to the Sprint Backlog; B files a Retrospective follow-up naming the class. Source the mechanism from [domain-mechanisms.md](domain-mechanisms.md) and never name one without the failure it prevents, per the honesty rule in [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md).
- Recommend: A leads when the class is one where a repeat is expensive or unrecoverable: money moved, data leaked, a message lost for good. B leads when a repeat would be visible and cheap to fix, and say that plainly in B's text.

Q9. What it cost while it was broken
- Text: From what I can see this has been wrong since `<when, from what you found>`. `<State what that means for the records concretely, e.g. "so every invite sent in the last eleven days has the wrong expiry stored against it">`. Does that need putting right too, or only the code?
- Header: Damage
- Options:
  - A. Fix the code and repair the affected records (Recommended)
    - What happens: I fix the cause, then correct what was already written wrong, and show you the count before and after.
  - B. Just the code, leave the old records alone
    - What happens: New ones will be right. The existing wrong ones stay wrong, and I'll tell you how many that is so it's a choice rather than an oversight.
  - C. Tell me how many are affected first
    - What happens: I count them and come back with the number before either of us decides.
  - D. Nobody was affected, it never reached real use
    - What happens: Code only, nothing to repair. Faster, and I'll confirm that's true before I rely on it.
- Why-this-matters: The half-fix this bank kept shipping. A code fix leaves a repair task unwritten, and nothing downstream notices, because the tests pass against the new behaviour. A adds a data-repair task to the Sprint Backlog with its own Evidence Ledger row (count before, count after). Never state a number of affected records that you did not count, per the honesty rule in [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md).
- Recommend: A leads whenever the wrong records are visible to anyone or feed anything else. D leads only when the user's own words say it never ran for real, never on your own assumption.

**EXIT CRITERIA**

Q4, Q5, Q6, Q7, Q9 answered (always required); Q8 answered if its COMPOSITION trigger fired; the Q7 right-behaviour written down as a concrete value and used as the RED test's assertion; the Q9 repair decision recorded, with a data-repair task in the plan when the answer is A; for Q1, Q2, Q3: either the question was answered OR its COMPOSITION skip condition fired and was logged; if Q1 = C, the task is re-routed to the `debug` bank and this bank's exit is bypassed; the regression-guard decision captured in the work-doc.
