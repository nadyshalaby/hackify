# Domain mechanisms (reference data, not a question bank)

Every bank in this directory asks one question of the form "here is the shape working systems use for this kind of problem, how much of it do you want". That question needs facts. The facts live here, once, so seven banks do not each carry their own copy of what a payments flow needs.

This file is **not** a question bank. It has no SCENARIO / COMPOSITION / QUESTIONS / EXIT CRITERIA sections and it is never sent to the user as-is. Phase 1 reads it, picks the one or two domains the request actually touches, and writes the mechanism into a question the user can answer. See [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md) for how that question must be worded, and [README.md](README.md) for the file map.

## How a bank uses this file

Four of the questions in each bank draw on it:

| The question | What it takes from here |
|---|---|
| The proven flow | The **Mechanisms** table for the matched domain. Name the mechanism and the failure it prevents, never the pattern's name alone. |
| The necessity challenge | The **Where the simple version is correct** line. It is what makes the small option a real option instead of a strawman. |
| What makes the rule correct | The **Correctness rules that bite here** list. Pick the one or two that this request actually touches. |
| Scale and consequence | The same **Where the simple version is correct** line, read in the other direction. |

## Three rules for using it

1. **Name the mechanism, name the failure.** "Every write carries an idempotency key, so a retry after a timeout cannot charge twice" is a fact the user can weigh. "This is the standard approach" is not. The full rule is the honesty rule in [wizard-contract.md](wizard-contract.md), and it binds every question that cites this file.
2. **Match the domain, not the vocabulary.** A refund is money. A password reset link is identity. A "send the report every Monday" toggle is scheduling plus messaging. Read the request for what it does, not for the words it used.
3. **Do not paste the table.** Pick the two or three mechanisms this request actually touches and write each one as a single short sentence in plain words, mechanism and failure together. A user reading twelve rows will pick the first option just to make it stop.

## When no domain matches

Some requests touch none of these. A colour change, a copy edit, a log line. Then there is no proven flow to offer and the question is cut, per the composition rules in [picking-and-combining.md](picking-and-combining.md). An invented mechanism is worse than a missing question.

## Money and payments

Charges, refunds, invoices, subscriptions, payouts, wallets, credits.

**The shape that works.** Money records are written once and never edited. A charge is a row. A refund is a separate row pointing back at the charge. The balance is the sum of the rows, not a number you keep updating.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| An idempotency key on every write that moves money, generated once per button press and resent unchanged on retry | A network timeout followed by a retry charging or refunding the customer twice |
| Append-only rows, with amounts held as whole numbers in the smallest unit (cents, fils, satang) | Rounding drift from decimal arithmetic, and losing the history of what was actually paid |
| An explicit currency stored beside every amount, never a global default | A 100 USD refund paid out as 100 EUR after someone changed a setting |
| Status driven by the payment provider's confirmation, not by your own optimism: you record "requested" and move to "settled" only when the provider confirms | Your records saying the money moved when it never did |
| A scheduled comparison of your rows against the provider's own report | Silent divergence that nobody notices for months |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- How amounts round, and where. Round once, in one function. Rounding twice is how totals stop matching their lines.
- Whether the total refunded can exceed the total charged, counted across every earlier partial refund.
- Which currency a cap is measured in when the original charge was converted.
- Who may issue a refund, and whether a second person has to approve above some amount.
- What has to be reconstructible a year later. At minimum: who did it, when, how much, against which charge.

**Where the simple version is correct.** One currency, refunds issued by staff only, under a few thousand transactions a month. You still need the idempotency key, whole-number amounts and the separate refund row, because those three are what stop real money going wrong. You do not need a double-entry engine, a reconciliation service or an approval workflow.

## Identity and sessions

Sign-up, login, password reset, tokens, sign-in with another provider, account recovery.

**The shape that works.** Prove who someone is once. Then carry a short-lived token you can revoke, and keep a separate longer-lived way to get a new one.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Passwords stored with a slow hash built for passwords (bcrypt, scrypt, argon2), never a fast general-purpose hash | A stolen database turning into stolen accounts within hours |
| A short-lived session token plus a refresh record the server can delete | A leaked token staying valid forever, because revoking it actually stops access |
| Server-side invalidation on password change and on "sign out everywhere" | An attacker keeping access after the victim changes the password |
| Rate limiting and lockout on login, counted per account **and** per source address | Attackers trying one common password against thousands of accounts |
| Reset links that are single-use, short-lived, and stored hashed | A reset link sitting in an old inbox opening the account a year later |
| Verifying an email or phone before it can receive anything sensitive | Account takeover through an address the attacker controls |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- How long a session lasts, and whether using the app extends it.
- Whether signing in on a second device ends the first session.
- What happens to an active session when the account is suspended.
- Whether the email address is the identity, and what happens when it changes.

**Where the simple version is correct.** One app, one login form, no sign-in with another provider. Use whatever session support your framework ships with, as shipped. Writing your own token format or your own password hashing is where teams get this wrong, and a separate identity service is an operations decision, not a starting point.

## Permissions and who sees whose records

Roles, sharing, ownership, admin views, customer accounts.

**The shape that works.** The check runs where the data is read, not where the screen is drawn. A screen that hides a button is a courtesy. The query is the security.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Every query filtered by the actor's scope in the data layer, not in each caller | One endpoint forgetting its check and returning everybody's rows |
| Deny by default, so a new endpoint with no rule attached refuses | The permission you forgot to write being the permission that leaks |
| Object-level checks, not just role checks. "Is an editor" is not "is an editor of this document" | Changing an id in the address bar loading another customer's record, which is the most common access bug in real products |
| Treating identifiers in URLs as public knowledge | Relying on an unguessable id instead of a check, which stops working the moment one id leaks |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Whether someone can still see a record they created after their access is removed.
- Whether a shared link keeps working when the person who shared it loses access.
- Who can read the history of who looked at what.

**Where the simple version is correct.** Two levels, staff and everyone else, covers most products for a long time. A role editor with custom permission sets is a feature you sell, not a foundation you need.

## Notifications and messaging

Email, SMS, push, in-app messages, digests, reminders.

**The shape that works.** The app writes down that a message should be sent. A separate worker sends it. A slow provider then never blocks the thing the user was doing.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Queueing the message instead of sending it inline | A checkout that fails because the email provider was slow |
| A deduplication key per recipient and event | A retried job emailing the same person five times |
| Recording delivery status per message | "Did they get it?" being unanswerable |
| An authenticated sending domain (SPF, DKIM and DMARC records) | Mail being rejected or filed as spam because nothing proves you sent it |
| Sending bulk mail from a different subdomain than receipts and password resets | A marketing send damaging the reputation that your password reset mail depends on |
| One-click unsubscribe on anything that is not strictly transactional | Spam complaints, which are what actually destroy deliverability |
| Stopping sends to addresses that bounced or complained | A growing pile of dead addresses dragging the whole domain down |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Which messages count as transactional (no unsubscribe needed) and which count as marketing (unsubscribe required by law in most countries).
- Whose timezone a scheduled send uses, and whether quiet hours apply.
- What happens when the same event fires twice.

**Where the simple version is correct.** Under a few thousand messages a month: one provider, one authenticated sending domain, a queue and a deduplication key. No preference centre, no template editor, and certainly no mail server of your own.

## Scheduling and recurrence

Bookings, reminders, recurring events, cron-style rules, availability, deadlines.

**The shape that works.** Store what the person meant, not the instant you calculated from it.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Storing the wall-clock time plus the timezone name (`Europe/Berlin`), never a fixed offset | Every recurring event shifting by an hour twice a year |
| Storing the repeat rule plus explicit exception rows for occurrences that moved or were cancelled | Editing one occurrence quietly rewriting the whole series |
| Generating occurrences from the rule on demand instead of writing years of rows up front | A rule change leaving stale occurrences behind |
| Treating the scheduler as at-least-once, so the job it fires is safe to run twice | A duplicate reminder, or worse, a duplicate charge |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Whose timezone defines "today": the viewer's, the account's, or the record's.
- What the monthly occurrence is for a series that started on the 31st.
- Whether a daylight-saving jump skips an occurrence or runs it twice.
- Whether editing the rule changes occurrences that already happened.

**Where the simple version is correct.** Fixed times, one timezone, no repeats. This is genuinely fine and far cheaper. Add the repeat-rule engine the first time somebody asks for "every second Tuesday", not before.

## Multi-tenant data isolation

One installation serving several companies, workspaces, teams or clients.

**The shape that works.** The tenant is part of every query, applied in one place, and it comes from the session rather than from the request.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| A tenant column on every row, enforced by the data layer rather than by each caller | One forgotten filter showing every customer's data to one customer |
| Taking the tenant from the authenticated session, never from a parameter the caller sends | Someone switching tenants by editing a field |
| A test that runs the suite as two tenants and asserts neither can see the other | The leak arriving as a customer email instead of as a failing test |
| Scoping export and deletion by tenant from the first day | A data request you cannot fulfil without hand-writing queries |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Whether one person can belong to two tenants, and how they switch.
- Whether identifiers are unique across the whole system or only inside a tenant.
- What happens to shared reference data that no single tenant owns.

**Where the simple version is correct.** One database with a tenant column carries most products a very long way. A separate database per tenant is an operations cost you take on when a contract requires it, not a design you start with.

---

## File upload and storage

Avatars, attachments, imports, exports, documents, media.

**The shape that works.** The file goes straight from the browser to the storage service. Your app hands out permission and never handles the bytes.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Uploading directly to storage with a short-lived signed URL | Large files filling your app's memory and blocking requests |
| Checking the file's real content to decide its type, not its name or what the browser claimed | An executable renamed to `.jpg` |
| Storing under a name you generate, never the name the user typed | Path traversal, collisions and surprising characters |
| Serving private files through short-lived signed links instead of a public bucket | An unlisted URL becoming a public one the moment it is shared |
| Removing location and device data from images unless the product needs it | Publishing a user's home address inside a photo |
| Enforcing the size cap at the storage service, not only in the browser | A caller who skips your page uploading anything they like |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Who may read a given file, and whether that follows the record it is attached to.
- What happens to the file when the record is deleted.
- Whether files are scanned, and whether they stay unreachable until the scan passes.

**Where the simple version is correct.** One bucket, a signed upload, a signed read, a size cap and a content check. Resizing, a delivery network and a media library come later, if at all.

---

## Search and listing

Tables, feeds, filters, sorting, pagination, autocomplete.

**The shape that works.** Page by a stable position in the sort order, not by counting rows to skip.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Cursor pagination on a stable sort key instead of "skip the first N" | Rows being skipped or shown twice while the list changes under the reader, and a deep page scanning a million rows to return twenty |
| A maximum page size the server enforces | One caller asking for everything and taking the database with them |
| An index on every column you filter or sort by, plus a tiebreaker column so the sort is deterministic | Two rows swapping places between page one and page two |
| Applying permission filters inside the query, not to the results afterwards | A page of twenty that shows three because seventeen were removed after the fact |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Whether the total count reflects what this reader is allowed to see.
- Whether an empty search box means everything or nothing.
- Whether the list is live or a snapshot, and whether the screen says which.

**Where the simple version is correct.** An indexed database query with cursor pagination and a page cap serves most lists well past the size teams expect. A separate search engine is a service to run, back up and keep in sync, so it should follow a query you can no longer express, not a hunch.

---

## Background jobs and retries

Queues, workers, imports, exports, scheduled tasks, anything slow.

**The shape that works.** Assume every job runs at least once and sometimes twice, and design so twice is harmless.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Making every job safe to run twice | A retry double-charging, double-emailing or double-counting |
| Retrying with growing gaps plus a small random delay | Every failed job retrying at the same instant and knocking the service over again |
| A retry limit, a place failed jobs land, and an alert when they do | A job failing forever in silence |
| A visible record of what was queued, what ran and what failed | "Did it run?" being unanswerable |
| Passing identifiers to the job so it re-reads current data, instead of passing a copy of the data | Acting on values that were already stale when the job started |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Whether jobs touching the same record must run in order.
- What a job does when it finds the record was deleted while it waited.
- How long a job may hold a lock before something else may take over.

**Where the simple version is correct.** The queue your framework ships with, backed by your existing database, handles a great deal. A dedicated queue service is for a throughput number you can state.

---

## External services and webhooks

Payment providers, shipping, accounting, calendars, anything that calls you back.

**The shape that works.** Verify it is really them, write down what arrived, then do the work somewhere else.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Verifying the signature on every inbound call before acting on it | Anyone who learns the URL marking orders as paid |
| Storing the sender's event id and ignoring repeats | A replayed delivery refunding twice |
| Saving the raw message before processing it | An unreproducible bug with no evidence left behind |
| Replying immediately and processing in a job | The sender treating you as down and retrying harder |
| Also checking by asking the provider on a schedule | A lost delivery leaving your records permanently wrong |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Which side is right when your record and theirs disagree.
- What happens when an event arrives for something you have not created yet.
- Whether events can arrive out of order, and what that does to status.

**Where the simple version is correct.** Verify, store, queue, and compare on a schedule. Four small things, and skipping any one of them is where the money bugs come from.

---

## Records, history and audit

Approvals, edits, status changes, anything a person might dispute later.

**The shape that works.** The current state is a view. The history is the record.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Append-only history rows for anything disputable | An argument with a customer that you cannot settle |
| Recording who, what, when, and the values before and after | A trail that says "something changed" and nothing more |
| Writing the history row in the same transaction as the change | A change that lands with no record of itself |
| Storing which version of the rules applied, not only the result | Re-running last year's calculation with this year's rates |
| Soft delete where the record has legal or financial meaning, real delete where privacy law requires it | Both losing evidence and keeping data you are not allowed to keep |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- How long the history is kept, and what removes it.
- Who may read the history, and whether reading it is itself recorded.
- Whether a deleted record still appears in past totals.

**Where the simple version is correct.** A "last changed by" and "last changed at" pair, plus a history table on the two or three tables that carry money or permissions. Recording every event in the whole product as the source of truth is a large architectural bet with a long tail.

---

## Counting, analytics and reporting

Dashboards, totals, usage limits, exports, charts.

**The shape that works.** Keep the raw events. Compute the totals from them. A stored counter you increment is a number you cannot repair.

| Mechanism | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| Counting from raw event rows rather than incrementing a saved counter | A counter drifting away from reality with no way to rebuild it |
| Fixing the timezone and the day boundary once, in one place | Two dashboards that disagree by one day and nobody able to say which is right |
| Precomputing daily totals only when the live query gets slow, and keeping the events so totals can be rebuilt | A bug in the rollup becoming permanent |
| Running heavy report queries against a copy or a read replica once they hurt | A dashboard load slowing down checkout |

**Correctness rules that bite here.**
- Which timezone defines "today" on the chart.
- Whether refunded, cancelled or deleted records still count in past totals.
- Whether the number is live or from last night, and whether the screen says so.

**Where the simple version is correct.** A grouped query over an indexed timestamp column is correct and fast for a long time. Reach for stored rollups when you can name the query that got slow.
