# Debug When Stuck — Phase 3b

Triggered when the implement phase fails to make progress after **2 honest attempts** at a fix on the same task. Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. **Always find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.**

This is a 4-phase scientific method. Do not skip phases. Do not let urgency push you into "just try X".

---

## Trigger conditions

Switch into debug mode when ANY of the following:

- ≥2 failed fix attempts on the same task in Phase 3
- A test failure whose error message contradicts the Plan section's expectation
- An unrelated test fails after your change (sign of unexpected coupling)
- Reproducing the bug requires steps that are not deterministic (intermittent)
- A user reports the feature doesn't work after you marked it done (post-Phase 6 regression)

When you enter debug mode, **update work-doc frontmatter**: `status: debugging`. Open a new section in the Implementation Log titled `### T<n> — debugging`.

---

## Phase D1 — Root cause investigation (BEFORE any fix)

### Step 1 — read the error carefully

- Full stack trace, not just the top line.
- Exact error code, file path, line number.
- Did anything change recently? Run `git log --oneline -20` and `git diff HEAD~5..HEAD <touched files>`.

### Step 2 — reproduce reliably

- What are the exact steps that produce it?
- Does it fail every time? Sometimes? Once?
- If intermittent — do not proceed to Phase D3 until you've made it deterministic. Intermittent reproductions hide race conditions, ordering issues, leaked state. Add logging at component boundaries until you can predict the failure.

### Step 3 — gather evidence at component boundaries

For multi-component systems (request → service → repo → DB; client → axios → server → HTTP framework → service → DB):

- For EACH boundary, log what data enters and what data exits.
- Run the failing scenario once.
- Note which boundary the data goes wrong at.
- Now you know **which component fails** — analyze just that one. Don't guess upstream.

Example boundaries in a typical layered backend:

```
[HTTP request]
  ↓ tenant-resolution middleware → adds tenant to context
[Route handler]
  ↓ request-body validation → fail here = validation issue
  ↓ service call
[Service]
  ↓ withTenantDb / transaction setup → fail here = pool / search_path / config issue
  ↓ ORM query → fail here = query construction
[Database]
  ↓ result mapping → fail here = type mismatch
[Service returns]
[Framework returns response]
```

Log entry/exit at each — find the layer.

### Step 4 — trace the bad value backward

If a value is wrong, trace it back through the call chain to its source. Don't fix the symptom; fix the source.

```
Q: Where is this bad value being USED?
   → Where is it COMING FROM (function arg, DB query, env)?
   → Who CALLED that with the bad value?
   → Where did THAT bad value come from?
   → ... keep going until you find the originating point.
```

Then fix at the origin, not at the place the bad value was observed.

## Phase D2 — Pattern analysis

If the codebase has a working analogue, this phase is gold. If not, skip to D3.

### Step 1 — find a working similar example

- Same module: is there another endpoint / service / form that does something analogous and works?
- Other modules: is there a different feature that uses the same library / pattern correctly?

### Step 2 — read the working example COMPLETELY

Don't skim. Read the file end-to-end. Note:

- Imports
- Setup (constructor, init, dependencies)
- The exact API call shape
- Error handling
- Type signatures
- Any subtle differences in how it's wired up

### Step 3 — list every difference between working and broken

Bullet list. Be exhaustive — including things that "shouldn't matter":

- Different env var?
- Different config option?
- Different version of the same dependency?
- Different middleware order?
- Different schema reference?

A difference you dismiss as "shouldn't matter" is often the cause.

## Phase D3 — Hypothesis & test (scientific method)

### Step 1 — write down ONE hypothesis

Verbatim, in the work-doc:

> **Hypothesis 1.** I think `<X>` is the root cause because `<Y>` (evidence: `<Z>`).

If you can't articulate it cleanly, you don't have a hypothesis yet — go back to D1.

### Step 2 — make the smallest possible change

ONE change, ONE variable. Do not bundle "fix X and also clean up Y."

### Step 3 — run, observe

- Did the failing test pass?
- Did all other tests stay green?
- Did the manual reproduction now work?

### Step 4 — outcome

- **Yes** → Phase D4. Implement properly with a test.
- **No** → revert your change. Form **a new hypothesis**. Do NOT pile on more fixes. Update the work-doc:

  > **Hypothesis 1.** Disproved. The change to `<X>` had no effect on the failure.
  > **Hypothesis 2.** ...

### Circuit breaker — STOP after 3 hypotheses

If 3 hypotheses fail, **stop and surface to the user**. This is no longer a failed hypothesis — it's an architectural problem. Each fix revealing a new problem in a different place is the strongest possible signal.

In the work-doc:

> **Halt.** 3 hypotheses tested, all disproved. The architecture appears wrong, not the code. Surfacing for discussion.

Then write a 1-paragraph summary of what you tried, what you learned, what you suspect the architectural issue is. Do not attempt fix #4.

---

## Phase D4 — Implement the fix properly

The hypothesis is confirmed. Don't ship the experimental change as-is. Do this:

### Step 1 — write a failing regression test

The test should:

- Fail before the fix (so you know it tests the right thing).
- Pass after the fix.
- Be the smallest reproduction possible.
- Cover the **source** of the bug, not just the symptom.

Run it. Watch it fail. (Same RED gate as TDD.)

### Step 2 — apply the fix at the source

ONE change. Address the root cause, not the symptom.

If you patched at the symptom site during D3 to confirm the hypothesis, **revert that** and apply the real fix at the source.

### Step 3 — verify

- The new failing test passes.
- All existing tests still pass.
- The manual reproduction no longer reproduces.

### Step 4 — return to Phase 3 / 4

Update work-doc:

- `status: implementing` (continue with remaining tasks) or `status: verifying` (if this was the last task).
- Tick the task's Tasks checkbox.
- Implementation Log entry includes the hypothesis chain (compressed) and the regression test.

## Forbidden patterns

These are the rationalizations that turn a 30-minute bug into a 3-hour bug. Catch yourself:

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "Quick fix for now, investigate later" | "Later" never comes. The symptom fix masks the source. |
| "Just try changing X and see if it works" | That's not a hypothesis, that's gambling. |
| "Add multiple changes, run tests" | If it passes you don't know which change worked. |
| "Skip the test, I'll manually verify" | Then you have nothing protecting against regression. |
| "It's probably X, let me just fix that" | "Probably" → write down the hypothesis first. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+) | The circuit breaker exists for a reason. |
| "Each fix reveals a new problem" | Architectural issue. Stop and escalate. |

## Working example (for orientation)

> **Bug.** `bun test test/integration/invitations.test.ts` fails with `expected 200 to equal 401`. The first attempt added `await` to the auth header parsing. Didn't help.
>
> **D1.** Stack trace points to the auth middleware. Added log at boundary: middleware sees a `Cookie: better-auth.session=…` header, returns 200. But test expects 401. Oh — the test calls a route that **does not** require auth. So the actual issue is the route handler itself returning 200 with no body, but the test asserts a specific JSON shape and the assertion library reports it as 401.
>
> **D2.** Compared with another integration test that works. Difference: that test sets `Accept: application/json`. Hmm — the HTTP framework's default response is plain text without it.
>
> **D3.** Hypothesis: missing `Accept: application/json` causes the framework to return non-JSON, which the test's `.body` parser then misinterprets as auth-required. Set the header. Test passes.
>
> **D4.** Wrote a regression test (new test name: `invitations endpoint returns JSON regardless of Accept header`). Watched it fail. Fixed by setting `c.json(…)` explicitly in the route (which forces content-type) instead of relying on the test sending `Accept`. Watched it pass. All other tests still green.

The forbidden version of the same bug:

> Tries adding `await`. Doesn't work. Tries adding error handling. Doesn't work. Tries upgrading the framework. Doesn't work. Now in a refactor of the whole middleware stack, 2 hours later, still failing.
