# Trace rubric — how to walk a stack with rigor

The viewer renders whatever the trace produces. A polished viewer over a sloppy trace is worthless; an ugly viewer over a sharp trace still ships decisions. This rubric is the IP of the skill.

Walk depth-first from the entry point. Capture exactly the fields named in [data-schema.md](./data-schema.md). When in doubt at a fork, **stop and ask** — never guess which branch the runtime takes.

---

## 0. Pre-step — read the repo's conventions before annotating

Before opening the entry function, spend 60-90 seconds reading the repo's structure and adjacent files. The trace must annotate in the repo's own idiom, not a generic one.

Specifically look at:

- **Framework signature** — is this NestJS, Express, Rails, Django, FastAPI, Spring, Phoenix? Layer naming follows the framework's vocabulary. NestJS has Controllers / Services / Repositories. Rails has Controllers / Models / Concerns. Don't impose NestJS layer labels on a Rails app.
- **DI patterns** — constructor injection, decorator-based DI, manual factories, ServiceLocator. The "called-by" graph depends on knowing where instances come from.
- **Module boundaries** — does the repo enforce module boundaries via an index file, a barrel export, a package boundary? When you see a call cross the boundary, that's load-bearing.
- **Error model** — does the repo throw, return `Result<T, E>`, return `[err, value]` tuples, return `null`-for-not-found-and-throw-for-bug, or something else? The "risk" field is meaningless without knowing the local error model.
- **Test convention** — `.spec.ts` next to source, `__tests__/` folder, `test/` mirror. Don't expand into test files when tracing production paths.

If the repo has a `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or `docs/` at the root, skim them. If it has a `CLAUDE.md` or `.cursorrules`, read it — the user explicitly wrote those for agents.

---

## 1. Confirm the entry point. Do not guess.

The user's `$ARGUMENTS` names ONE entry. Resolve it to a single function with a file path and a line range. If any of the following are true, **stop and ask the user**:

| Ambiguity | Example | What to ask |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple matching definitions | Two `getUser` functions in different modules | "I found `getUser` at `src/controllers/user.controller.ts:42` and `src/admin/user.controller.ts:18`. Which one?" |
| Runtime-conditional entry | Express route registered behind `if (process.env.FEATURE_X)` | "The route only registers when `FEATURE_X` is set. Trace with the flag on, off, or both?" |
| Tenant-guarded entry | Same handler delegated by tenant ID | "This handler dispatches by `req.tenant.id`. Which tenant's path?" |
| DI-token resolution | `@Inject(USER_REPO_TOKEN)` with multiple providers | "`USER_REPO_TOKEN` resolves to one of `PostgresUserRepo`, `MockUserRepo`. Which?" |
| Dynamic dispatch | `handlers[type](payload)` | "`handlers[type]` is a map. Which `type` value should I trace?" |

After the user picks, write the chosen path into the chat in one line — "Tracing entry: `<file>:<line>` for `<entry_point>`" — so the choice is visible in transcript.

---

## 2. Walk depth-first. One function at a time.

For every function on the path, extract the fields from `data-schema.md` in this exact order:

1. **`file`, `function_range`, `name`** — open the file, locate the function, note declaration line and end-of-body line. Both 1-indexed. Inclusive.
2. **`source`** — read the function body verbatim. Do not normalize whitespace. Do not strip comments.
3. **Identify the invoked block.** See §3 below — this is the hardest part.
4. **`call_sites`** — for each outgoing call ON THE INVOKED PATH, record line + fragment + callee ID. Calls inside `if`/`else`/`switch` arms that don't fire on this path do NOT count.
5. **`docblock.purpose`** — one sentence. What does this function DO in the domain, not in implementation terms. "Resolves a user by id" beats "calls `findById` and maps the row."
6. **`docblock.inputs`** — name + shape pseudocode. List params and read-from-closure values. `req.user` counts as an input when the function reads it.
7. **`docblock.outputs`** — return shape. `void` if pure side-effect.
8. **`docblock.side_effects`** — pick from the fixed set: `db`, `queue`, `http`, `cache`, `auth`, `fs`. See §4 below for what falls into each.
9. **`docblock.ownership`** — one or two sentences on WHY this layer owns this responsibility. "Controllers translate HTTP to domain; tenant scoping happens above this." This is the field that lets the user judge whether the layering is sound.
10. **`data_in` / `data_out`** — the payload as it enters / leaves. See §5 below — the trace's job is to show how shape transforms across the path.
11. **`risk`** — exactly ONE concrete risk, smell, or load-bearing assumption. Not three. Pick the one that matters most. See §6 below.
12. **`branches_not_taken`** — every `if`/`else`/`switch`/`try`/`catch` arm in this function that the runtime DID NOT take on this path. Name + one-line trigger condition. **Do NOT expand them into nodes.** See §7 below.
13. **`git_blame`** — `git log -1 --pretty=format:'%an|%ad|%s' --date=short -- <file>` for last author + date. If the commit message references a PR (`(#1234)` or `Merge pull request #1234`), capture the PR number. If the file is untracked, set `git_blame: null`.
14. **`layer`** — pick one of `controller`, `service`, `repository`, `external`, `other`. Use the repo's own framework vocabulary as the tie-breaker.

---

## 3. Identifying the invoked block (the hardest part)

The `invoked_range` and `invoked_lines` fields are what give the viewer its green-highlight; everything dimmed in the viewer is code that didn't fire. Getting this right matters more than any single docblock field.

Approach:

1. Start with `invoked_range = function_range` — assume the whole body fires.
2. Walk the function body top to bottom. For every conditional:
   - **`if (cond) { A } else { B }`** — if you know which arm fires on this path, mark the OTHER arm as not-invoked. The lines of the not-invoked arm are removed from `invoked_lines`.
   - **`switch (k)`** — only the matching `case` (and any fallthrough) is invoked.
   - **`try { A } catch { B }`** — the catch fires only if `A` throws. On a happy-path trace, `B` is not invoked. If you're tracing an error path explicitly, the opposite.
   - **Short-circuit `&&` / `||`** — if the left side decides, the right side may not fire. Count cautiously; when in doubt, include the line.
   - **Early `return`** — if the function returns at line N, lines after N do not fire.
3. After the walk, narrow `invoked_range` to `[min(invoked_lines), max(invoked_lines)]`. This is the visible range in the viewer; lines outside it are not shown at all.
4. **If you can't tell which arm fires** — a runtime-resolved condition like `if (config.featureX)` where `featureX` depends on env or DB state — **stop and ask the user**. Do not guess. The whole skill exists to surface this ambiguity, not to paper over it.

**Common failure mode:** marking *every* line as invoked because "the function ran." That defeats the green-highlight. If the function has a 30-line `else` arm that didn't fire, those 30 lines must NOT be in `invoked_lines`.

---

## 4. Side-effect classification

Use exactly these six labels. Be precise — the chips in the viewer drive trust.

| Label | Counts as | Does NOT count as |
|---|---|---|
| `db` | SQL queries, ORM calls, NoSQL gets/puts, raw DB driver calls | reading from an in-memory cache that happens to back a DB |
| `queue` | Enqueueing or dequeuing from any message broker (SQS, RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis streams, BullMQ) | direct function calls between modules |
| `http` | Outbound HTTP calls (`fetch`, `axios`, gRPC, GraphQL clients) AND inbound HTTP response writes | internal RPC inside the same process |
| `cache` | Redis `GET`/`SET`, Memcached, in-memory LRU writes | local variables that happen to be reused |
| `auth` | Token mint/verify, password check, permission/role lookup, session read/write | reading `req.user` that was already populated upstream |
| `fs` | File read/write/delete, directory listing, stat calls | reading from a process-memory buffer that was once a file |

A function with no side effects on this path gets `side_effects: []`. That's normal for pure mappers and validators.

## 5. Data-shape evolution

`data_in` and `data_out` are how the trace shows the payload morphing across the path. Aim for typed pseudocode, not prose:

- Good: `{ id: string, requester: AuthContext }`
- Good: `UserRow | null`
- Good: `PublicUser`
- Bad: `the user object after lookup` (prose)
- Bad: `User` (no field-level detail — useless for spotting field drops)

When a layer narrows the shape (DB row → public DTO), capture that. The Diagrams tab's "data evolution" chain reads `data_out` of node N and `data_in` of node N+1 — when those disagree, the viewer surfaces the mismatch.

---

## 6. Picking the ONE risk

The brief is explicit: one risk per node, not a list. The risk field is the most-read piece of metadata in the right rail. If you list three, the reader skims and remembers none.

Pick the one that meets the highest of these bars:

1. A **load-bearing assumption** the function makes without checking — `assumes req.user is set; middleware order matters`.
2. A **silent collision** — `returns null for both not-found and downstream error; caller can't distinguish`.
3. A **layer leak** — `controller does business logic the service should own`.
4. A **race or concurrency hazard** — `read-modify-write without a lock or transaction`.
5. A **performance cliff** — `N+1 query inside a loop over the request body`.

If none of those apply, write `"none observed on this path"`. Empty is honest; padding the field with "consider extracting a helper" is noise.

---

## 7. Branches not taken — listed by name, never expanded

For every conditional in the function body that the runtime did not take on this path, add ONE entry to `branches_not_taken`:

```json
{ "name": "soft-deleted user path", "trigger": "req.query.includeDeleted === 'true'" }
```

- `name` — a SHORT human-readable label. Not the code expression — the meaning. "soft-deleted user path", "admin override path", "cache hit path".
- `trigger` — the exact condition that would have routed to this branch instead. One line. Code-fragment OK.

**Do not recurse into the branch.** The whole point is to mark the road-not-traveled so the user knows it exists, without ballooning the trace. The Diagrams tab renders all deferred branches in one place so the user can see what was skipped.

If the user later wants to trace the deferred branch, that's a new `/codewalk` run with a different entry-point hint (e.g., "the admin override path of `getUser`"). New `data.json`, new viewer.

---

## 8. The 5-function depth check (procedural, not soft)

Every 5 functions added to the trace, STOP and print this block to chat verbatim, filled in:

```
─── codewalk depth check ───
nodes so far: 5
max depth reached: 3
deferred branches accumulated: 7
last node: src/services/user.service.ts:findById (layer: service, side_effects: [db])
next planned: src/repositories/user.repo.ts:queryById
continue / switch branch / stop?
───
```

Wait for the user before continuing. The defaults are:

- **continue** — keep walking DFS from `next planned`.
- **switch branch** — user picks one of the `deferred_branches` to trace instead. The current DFS pauses (the deferred branch becomes the new active DFS); when it terminates, control returns to the original.
- **stop** — finalize the trace at the current state. `nodes` is locked, `data.json` is written, viewer materializes.

This block is the difference between a useful trace and a runaway DFS. It is not optional. If the path is shorter than 5 functions total, print the block once at the end with `continue?` replaced by `finalize?`.

---

## 9. After the trace — chat output, not HTML

The viewer is the deliverable. But before handing off to the user, print TWO things to chat:

**Comprehension questions (5).** Answerable only by someone who internalized the flow. Examples:

> 1. Where in the path is `tenantId` first read, and what would break if it were undefined at the entry?
> 2. The service returns `null` for not-found. How does the controller distinguish that from a thrown DB error?
> 3. If `userService.findById` were promoted to use a cache, which node's `side_effects` chip would change and what new risk appears?
> 4. The repository's transaction context comes from where, and is it the same instance across the two queries on this path?
> 5. One of the deferred branches changes the response shape. Which one, and how?

These are not rhetorical — they're an offer to the user. "If any of these feel un-answerable, the trace is incomplete somewhere; want me to deepen?"

**Decisions you can now make.** A short checklist sorted into three buckets:

```
Safe to change:
  - The DTO mapper in the controller (pure, no side effects, tested)

Load-bearing:
  - The middleware order (AuthGuard before TenantGuard) — swapping breaks auth/tenant interaction

Chesterton's fence (don't touch until you ask):
  - The fallback that returns `null` when `req.user` is missing — looks dead, but the public/health endpoint relies on it
```

Each item: one short line. If a bucket is empty, write `- (none on this path)`. The point is to let the user end the session with action, not a feeling of being informed.
